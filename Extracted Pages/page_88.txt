Piggy spoke, also dribbling.
"Aren't I having none?"
Jack had  meant to leave him in d oubt, as an assertion of power; but Piggy
by advertising his omission made more cruelty necessary .
"Y ou didn't hunt."
"No mo re did Ralph," said Pi ggy wetly , "nor Simon." He a mplified.
"There isn't more than a ha'porth of meat in a crab."
Ralph stirred uneasily . Simon, si tting between the twins and Pig gy , wiped
his mouth and shoved his piece of meat over the rocks to Piggy , who
grabbed it. The twins giggled and Simon lowered his face in shame.
Then Jac k leapt to his feet, slashed of f a great hunk of meat, an d flung it
down at Simon's feet.
"Eat! Damn you!"
He glared at Simon.
"T ake it!"
He spun on his heel, center of a bewildered circle of boys.
"I got you meat!"
Numberless and inexpressible frustrations combined to make his rage
elemental and awe-inspiring.
"I painted my face―I stole up. Now you eat―all of you―and I―"
Slowly t he silen ce on the moun tain-top deepened till the click o f the fire
and the soft hiss  of roasting meat could be heard clearly . Jack looked round
for understandin g but found onl y respect. Ralph stood among the ashes of
the signal fire, his hands full of meat, saying nothing.
