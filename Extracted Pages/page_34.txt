"That's a reef. A coral reef. I've seen pictures like that."
The reef enclosed more than on e side of the island, lying perhaps a mile
out and parallel to what they no w thought of as their beach. The coral was
scribbled in the sea as though a giant had bent down to reproduce the shape
of the island in a  flowing chalk line but tired before he had finished. Inside
was peacock water , rocks and weeds showing as in an aquarium; outside
was the dark blue of the sea. The tide was running so that lon g streaks of
foam tai led awa y from the reef and for a moment they felt that the boat was
moving steadily astern.
Jack pointed down.
"That's where we landed."
Beyond falls and clif fs there w as a gash visible in the trees; th ere were
the splintered trunks and then  the drag, leaving only a fringe of palm
between the scar and the sea. T here, too, jutting into the lagoon, was the
platform, with insect-like figures moving near it.
Ralph sk etched a twining line from the bald spot on which th ey stood
down a slope, a  gully , through f lowers, round and down to the rock where
the scar started.
"That's the quickest way back."
Eyes sh ining, mouths open, triumphant, they savored the right of
domination. They were lifted up: were friends.
"There's no village smoke, and n o boats," said Ralph wisely . "W e'll make
sure later; but I think it's uninhabited."
"W e'll get food," cried Jack. "Hunt. Catch things. until they fetch us."
Simon lo oked at  them both, sayi ng nothing but nodding till his black hair
flopped backwards and forwards: his face was glowing.
