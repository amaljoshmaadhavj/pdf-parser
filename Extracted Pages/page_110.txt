There was a mo ment's struggle and the glimmering conch jigge d up and
down. Ralph leapt to his feet.
"Jack! Jack! Y ou haven't got the conch! Let him speak."
Jack's face swam near him.
"And you shut up! Who are yo u, anyway? Sitting there telling people
what to do. Y ou can't hunt, you can't sing―"
"I'm chief. I was chosen."
"Why should choosing make an y dif ference? Just giving orders that don't
make any sense―"
"Piggy's got the conch."
"That's right―favor Piggy as you always do―"
"Jack!"
Jack's voice sounded in bitter mimicry .
"Jack! Jack!"
"The rules!" shouted Ralph. "Y ou're breaking the rules!"
"Who cares?"
Ralph summoned his wits.
"Because the rules are the only thing we've got!"
But Jack was shouting against him.
"Bollocks to the rules! W e're strong―we hunt! If there's a beast, we'll
hunt it down! W e'll close in and beat and beat and beat―!"
