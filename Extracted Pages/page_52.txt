They assented. Piggy opened hi s mouth to speak, caught Jack's eye and
shut it again. Jack held out his hands for the conch and stood up, holding
the delicate thing carefully in his sooty hands.
"I ag ree with R alph. W e've got to have rules and obey them. After all,
we're not savages. W e're English, and the English are best at everything. So
we've got to do the right things."
He turned to Ralph.
"Ralph, I'll split up the choir―my hunters, that is―into groups,  and we'll
be responsible for keeping the fire going―"
This gen erosity brought a spatter of applause from the boys, so that Jack
grinned at them, then waved the conch for silence.
"W e'll let the fire burn out now . Who would see smoke at night-time,
anyway? And we can start the fire again whenever we like. Alt os, you can
keep the fire going this week, and trebles the next―"
The assembly assented gravely .
"And we 'll be responsible for ke eping a lookout too. If we see a  ship out
there"―they fol lowed the direction of his bony arm with their eyes―"we'll
put green branches on. Then there'll be more smoke."
They gazed intently at the dense blue of the horizon, as if a little
silhouette might appear there at any moment.
The sun in the west was a drop of burning gold that slid nearer and nearer
the sill of the world. All at once they were aware of the evening as the end
of light and warmth.
Roger took the conch and looked round at them gloomily .
"I've bee n watching the sea. The re hasn't been the trace of a ship . Perhaps
we'll never be rescued."
A murmur rose and swept away . Ralph took back the conch.
