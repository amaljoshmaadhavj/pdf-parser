"He wants to know what you're going to do about the snake-thing."
Ralph la ughed, and the other boys laughed with him. The small boy
twisted further into himself.
"T ell us about the snake-thing."
"Now he says it was a beastie."
"Beastie?'
"A snake-thing. Ever so big. He saw it."
"Where?"
"In the woods."
Either th e wand ering breezes or perhaps the decline of the sun a llowed a
little coolness to lie under the trees. The boys felt it and stirred restlessly .
"Y ou co uldn't ha ve a beastie, a snake-thing, on an island this size," Ralph
explained kindly . "Y ou only get them in big countries, like Africa, or India."
Murmur; and the grave nodding of heads.
"He says the beastie came in the dark."
"Then he couldn't see it!"
Laughter and cheers.
"Did you hear that? Says he saw the thing in the dark―"
"He still says he  saw the beastie . It came and went away again an' came
back and wanted to eat him―"
"He was dreaming."
