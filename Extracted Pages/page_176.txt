Simon moved his swollen tongue but said nothing.
"Don't y ou agree?" said the Lord  of the Flies. "Aren't you just a silly little
boy?"
Simon answered him in the same silent voice.
"W ell th en," said the Lord of the Flies, "you'd better run of f and play with
the others. They think you're batty . Y ou don't want Ralph to think you're
batty , do you? Y ou like Ralph a lot, don't you? And Piggy , and Jack?"
Simon's head was tilted slightly  up. His eyes could not break away and
the Lord of the Flies hung in space before him.
"What are you doing out here all alone? Aren't you afraid of me?"
Simon shook.
"There isn't anyone to help you. Only me. And I'm the Beast."
Simon's mouth labored, brought forth audible words.
"Pig's head on a stick."
"Fancy thinking the Beast was s omething you could hunt and k ill!" said
the h ead. For a moment or two t he forest and all the other dimly appreciated
places e choed w ith the parody o f laughter . "Y ou knew , didn't y ou? I'm part
of y ou? Close, close, close! I'm  the reason why it's no go? Wh y things are
what they are?"
The laughter shivered again.
"Come now ," said the Lord of the Flies. "Get back to the others and we'll
for get the whole thing."
Simon's head wobbled. His ey es were half closed as though he were
imitating the obscene thing on the stick. He knew that one of his times was
coming on. The Lord of the Flies was expanding like a balloon.
