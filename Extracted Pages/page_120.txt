"Y ou can't go out―it's horrible!"
"Piggy―where are the spears?"
"I can hear the―"
"Quiet then. Lie still."
They lay  there listening, at firs t with doubt but then with terror to the
description the twins breathed at them between bouts of extreme silence.
Soon the darkness was full of claws, full of the awful unknown and menace.
An i nterminable  dawn faded th e stars out, and at last light, sad and grey ,
filtered into the shelter . They began to stir though still the world outside the
shelter was impossibly dangero us. The maze of the darkness  sorted into
near and  far , and at the high p oint of the sky the cloudlets were warmed
with col or . A single sea bird flapped upwards with a hoarse c ry that was
echoed presently , and somethin g squawked in the forest. Now streaks of
cloud near the horizon began t o glow rosily , and the feathery tops of the
palms were green.
Ralph knelt in t he entrance to the shelter and peered cautious ly round
him.
"Sam 'n Eric. Call them to an assembly . Quietly . Go on."
The twin s, holdi ng tremulously to each other , dared the few yards to the
next she lter and  spread the drea dful news. Ralph stood up and  walked for
the sake  of dignity , though with his back pricking, to the plat form. Piggy
and Simon followed him and the other boys came sneaking after .
Ralph to ok the conch from wher e it lay on the polished seat and held it to
his lips; but then  he hesitated an d did not blow . He held the shell up instead
and showed it to them and they understood.
The rays  of the sun that were fanning upwards from below the horizon
swung downwards to eye-level. Ralph looked for a moment at the growing
slice of gold that lit them from the right hand and seemed to make speech
possible. The circle of boys before him bristled with hunting spears.
