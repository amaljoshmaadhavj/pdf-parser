"I don't know ."
He r emembered  the panic flight down the mountainside. "I do n't think
we'd ever fight a thing that size, honestly , you know . W e'd talk but we
wouldn't fight a tiger . W e'd hide. Even Jack 'ud hide."
Jack still looked at the sand.
"What about my hunters?"
Simon came stealing out of the  shadows by the shelters. Ralph ignored
Jack's question. He pointed to the touch of yellow above the sea.
"As lon g as there's light we're brave enough. But then? And now that
thing squats by the fire as though it didn't want us to be rescued―"
He was twisting his hands now , unconsciously . His voice rose.
"So we can't have a signal fire.... W e're beaten."
A point of gold appeared above the sea and at once all the sky lightened.
"What about my hunters?"
"Boys armed with sticks."
Jack got  to his f eet. His face wa s red as he marched away . Piggy put on
his one glass and looked at Ralph.
"Now you done it. Y ou been rude about his hunters."
"Oh shut up!"
The sou nd of the inexpertly blown conch interrupted them. As though he
were serenading the rising sun, Jack went on blowing till the shelters were
astir and the hunters crept to the platform and the littluns whimpered as now
they so frequent ly did. Ralph ro se obediently , and Piggy , and t hey went to
the platform.
