"W e ought to go an' tell Piggy―"

"W e ought to tell Piggy―in case―"
"Robert? Bill?"
They were going straight back to the platform now . Not, of course, that
they were afraid―but tired.
Ralph turned back to Jack.
"Y ou see?"
"I'm goi ng up the mountain." The words came from Jack viciously , as
though they were a curse. He looked at Ralph, his thin body tensed, his
spear held as if he threatened him.
"I'm going up the mountain t o look for the beast―now ." Then the
supreme sting, the casual, bitter word. "Coming?"
At that word the other boys for got their ur ge to be gone and turned back
to sampl e this fresh rub of two spirits in the dark. The word wa s too good,
too bitte r , too successfully dau nting to be repeated. It took Ralph at low
water when his nerve was relaxed for the return to the shelter and the still,
friendly waters of the lagoon.
"I don't mind."
Astonished, he heard his voice  come out, cool and casual, so that the
bitterness of Jack's taunt fell powerless.
"If you don't mind, of course."
"Oh, not at all."
