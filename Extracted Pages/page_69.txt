Simon paused. He looked over his shoulder as Jack had done at the close
ways be hind him  and glanced s wiftly round to confirm that he  was utterly
alone. For a moment his movements were almost furtive. Then he bent
down an d wormed his way into  the center of the mat. The creep ers and the
bushes w ere so close that he left  his sweat on them and they pul led together
behind h im. When he was secure in the middle he was in a little cabin
screened of f from the open spac e by a few leaves. He squatted d own, parted
the leaves and looked out into the clearing. Nothing moved b ut a pair of
gaudy butterflies that danced round each other in the hot air . Holding his
breath he cocked a critical ear at the sounds of the island. Evening was
advancing toward the island; the sounds of the bright fantasti c birds, the
bee-sounds, eve n the crying of the gulls that were returning to their roosts
among the square rocks, were fainter . The deep sea breaking miles away on
the reef made an undertone le ss perceptible than the susurration of the
blood.
Simon dropped the screen of lea ves back into place. The slope of the bars
of honey -colored sunlight decre ased; they slid up the bushes, passed over
the green candle-like buds, moved up toward the canopy , and darkness
thickened under  the trees. W ith  the fading of the light the rio tous colors
died and the heat and ur gency cooled away . The candlebuds stirred. Their
green se pals dr ew back a little and the white tips of the flowers rose
delicately to meet the open air .
Now the sunlight had lifted clear of the open space and withdrawn from
the s ky . Darkness poured out, s ubmer ging the ways between the trees till
they were dim and strange as the bottom of the sea. The candle-buds
opened their wide white flowers glimmering under the light that pricked
down from the first stars. Their scent spilled out into the air and took
possession of the island.
