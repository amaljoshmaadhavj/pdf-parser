CHAPTER ELEVEN
     
Castle Rock
     
In the short chil l of dawn the four boys gathered round the bl ack smudge
where the fire had been, while Ralph knelt and blew . Grey , feathery ashes
scurried hither and thither at his breath but no spark shone am ong them.
The twins watched anxiously and Piggy sat expressionless behind the
luminous wall of his myopia. Ralph continued to blow till his ears were
singing with the ef fort, but then the first breeze of dawn took the job of f his
hands and blinded him with as hes. He squatted back, swore, and rubbed
water out of his eyes.
"No use."
Eric loo ked dow n at him through a mask of dried blood. Piggy peered in
the general direction of Ralph.
" 'Course it's no use, Ralph. Now we got no fire."
Ralph brought his face within a couple of feet of Piggy's.
"Can you see me?"
"A bit."
Ralph allowed the swollen flap of his cheek to close his eye again.
"They've got our fire."
Rage shrilled his voice.
"They stole it!"
