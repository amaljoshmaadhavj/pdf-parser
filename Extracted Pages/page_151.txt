Ashes blew into Ralph's face from the dead fire. He could not see the gap
or an ything else, because the gr een lights were opening again and growing,
and the top of the mountain was sliding sideways.
Once more, from a distance, he heard Jack's whisper .
"Scared?"
Not scar ed so much as paralyzed; hung up there immovable on the top of
a dim inishing, moving mountain . Jack slid away from him, Roger bumped,
fumbled with a hiss of breat h, and passed onwards. He heard them
whispering.
"Can you see anything?"
"There―"
In front of them, only three or four yards away , was a rock-l ike hump
where n o rock should be. Ralph could hear a tiny chattering no ise coming
from somewhere― perhaps f rom his own mouth. He bound himself
together with his will, fused his  fear and loathing into a hatred, and stood
up. He took two leaden steps forward.
Behind them the silver of moon had drawn clear of the horizo n. Before
them, so mething like a great ape  was sitting asleep with its head between its
knees. Then the wind roared in the forest, there was confusion in the
darkness and the creature lifted its head, holding toward them t he ruin of a
face.
Ralph found himself taking gia nt strides among the ashes, he ard other
creatures crying  out and leaping  and dared the impossible on the dark slope;
presently the mountain was des erted, save for the three aband oned sticks
and the thing that bowed.
