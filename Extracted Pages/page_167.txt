At length even this palled. Jack  began to clean his bloody hands on the
rock. Th en he started work on the sow and paunched her , lugging out the

"W e'll ta ke the meat along the beach. I'll go back to the plat form and
invite them to a feast. That should give us time."
Roger spoke.
"Chief―"
"Uh―?"
"How can we make a fire?"
Jack squatted back and frowned at the pig.
"W e'll ra id them and take fire. There must be four of you; Henry  and you,
Robert a nd Maurice. W e'll put on paint and sneak up; Roger c an snatch a
branch while I say what I want. The rest of you can get this back to where
we were. W e'll build the fire there. And after that―"
He paused and stood up, looking at the shadows under the trees. His
voice was lower when he spoke again.
"But we'll leave part of the kill for ..."
He knelt down again and was busy with his knife. The boys crowded
