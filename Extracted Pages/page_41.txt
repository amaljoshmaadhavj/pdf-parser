"Nobody knows  where we are," said Piggy . He was paler than b efore and
breathless. "Perhaps they knew  where we was going to; and perhaps not.
But they don't know where we  are 'cos we never got there." H e gaped at
them for a moment, then swayed and sat down. Ralph took the conch from
his hands.
"That's what I was going to say ," he went on, "when you all, all...." He
gazed at  their intent faces. "The plane was shot down in flam es. Nobody
knows where we are. W e may be here a long time."
The silence was so complete that they could hear the unevenness of
Piggy's b reathing. The sun slanted in and lay golden over half th e platform.
The breezes that on the lagoon had chased their tails like k ittens were
finding t heir wa y across the plat form and into the forest. Ralph pushed back
the tangle of fair hair that hung on his forehead.
"So we may be here a long time."
Nobody said anything. He grinned suddenly .
"But thi s is a go od island. W e―Jack, Simon and me― we cli mbed the
mountain. It's wizard. There's food and drink, and―"
"Rocks―"
"Blue flowers―"
Piggy , partly recovered, pointed  to the conch in Ralph's hands, and Jack
and Simon fell silent. Ralph went on.
"While we're waiting we can have a good time on this island."
He gesticulated widely .
"It's like in a book."
      At once there was a clamor .
"T reasure Island―"
