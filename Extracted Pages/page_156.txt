"All this talk!" shouted Ralph. "T alk, talk! Who wanted it? W ho called
the meeting?"
Jack turned, red in the face, his chin sunk back. He glowered up under his
eyebrows.
"All right then," he said in tones of deep meaning, and menace, "all
right."
He held the conch against his chest with one hand and stabbe d the air
with his index finger .
"Who thinks Ralph oughtn't to be chief?"
He l ooked expectantly at the bo ys ranged round, who had frozen. Under
the palms there was deadly silence.
"Hands up," said Jack strongly , "whoever wants Ralph not to be chief?"
The sile nce continued, breathle ss and heavy and full of shame. Slowly
the red drained f rom Jack's cheeks, then came back with a pain ful rush. He
licked his lips and turned his head at an angle, so that his gaze avoided the
embarrassment of linking with another's eye.
"How many think―"
His voic e tailed of f. The hands t hat held the conch shook. He cleared his
throat, and spoke loudly .
"All right then."
He laid the conch with great car e in the grass at his feet. The humiliating
tears were running from the corner of each eye.
"I'm not going to play any longer . Not with you."
Most of the boys were looking down now , at the grass or their feet. Jack
cleared his throat again.
