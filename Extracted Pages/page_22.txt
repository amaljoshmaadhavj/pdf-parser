"There's no man with a trumpet. Only me."
The boy came close and peered  down at Ralph, screwing up his face as
he d id s o. What  he saw of the f air -haired boy with the creamy shell on his
knees did not s eem to satisfy him. He turned quickly , his black cloak
circling.
"Isn't there a ship, then?"
Inside the floating cloak he was tall, thin, and bony; and his hair was red
beneath the black cap. His fa ce was crumpled and freckled, and ugly

"Isn't there a man here?"
Ralph spoke to his back.
"No. W e're having a meeting. Come and join in."
The grou p of cloaked boys bega n to scatter from close line. The tall boy
shouted at them.
"Choir! Stand still!"
W earily obedien t, the choir huddled into line and stood there swaying in
the sun. None the less, some began to protest faintly .
"But, Merridew . Please, Merridew ... can't we?"
Then one of the  boys flopped o n his face in the sand and the line broke
up. They heaved the fallen boy to the platform and let him lie. Merridew ,
his eyes staring, made the best of a bad job.
"All right then. Sit down. Let him alone."
"But Merridew ."
