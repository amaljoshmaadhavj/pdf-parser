"What's the matter?"
Ralph turned.
"Why?"
"Y ou were looking―I don't know why ."
"There's no signal now . Nothing to show ."
"Y ou're nuts on the signal."
The taut blue horizon encircled them, broken only by the mountain-top.
"That's all we've got."
He lean ed his spear against the rocking stone and pushed back two
handfuls of hair .
"W e'll h ave to go back and clim b the mountain. That's where they saw
the beast."
"The beast won't be there."
"What else can we do?"

cover into the sunlight. They  for got the beast in the excitement of
exploration. They swarmed across the bridge and soon were climbing and
shouting. Ralph  stood now , one hand against an enormous red block, a
block la r ge as a mill wheel th at had been split of f and hung, tottering.

eyes yearned beneath the fringe of hair .
