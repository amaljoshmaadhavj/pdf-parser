complication of lines. When the  breeze blew , the lines would strain taut and
some accident of this pull lifted the head and chest upright so that the figure
seemed to peer across the brow  of the mountain. Then, each time the wind
dropped, the lines would slacken and the figure bow forward again, sinking
its head between  its knees. So as the stars moved across the sky , the figure
sat on the mountain-top and bowed and sank and bowed again.
In th e da rkness of early morning  there were noises by a rock a little way
down the side o f the mountain. T wo boys rolled out a pile of brushwood
and dead  leaves,  two dim shado ws talking sleepily to each other . They were
the t wins, on duty at the fire. In theory one should have been asl eep and one
on watch. But they could never  manage to do things sensibly if that meant
acting in dependently , and since staying awake all night was impossible,
they had both gone to sleep. Now they approached the darker smudge that
had been the signal fire, yaw ning, rubbing their eyes, treading with
practiced feet. When they reached it they stopped yawning, a nd one ran
quickly back for brushwood and leaves.
The other knelt down.
"I believe it's out."
He fiddled with the sticks that were pushed into his hands.
"No."
He lay down an d put his lips close to the smudge and blew s of fly . His
face appeared, lit redly . He stopped blowing for a moment.
"Sam―give us―"
"―tinder wood."
Eric bent down and blew softly again till the patch was bri ght. Sam
poked the piece of tinder wood into the hot spot, then a branch. The glow
increased and the branch took fire. Sam piled on more branches.
"Don't burn the lot," said Eric, "you're putting on too much."
