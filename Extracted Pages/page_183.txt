Jack waved his spear again.
"Has everybody eaten as much as they want?"
There w as still food left, sizzling on the wooden spits, heaped on the
green platters. Betrayed by his stomach, Piggy threw a picked bone down
on the beach and stooped for more.
Jack spoke again, impatiently .
"Has everybody eaten as much as they want?"
His tone  convey ed a warning, g iven out of the pride of ownership, and
the boys ate f aster while there was still time. Seeing there was no
immediate likeli hood of a pause, Jack rose from the log that was his throne
and saun tered to  the edge of the grass. He looked down from behind his
paint at Ralph and Piggy . They moved a little farther of f over t he sand and
Ralph watched the fire as he at e. He noticed, without understanding, how
the f lames were visible now against the dull light. Evening was come, not
with calm beauty but with the threat of violence.
Jack spoke.
"Give me a drink."
Henry b rought h im a shell and he drank, watching Piggy and Ralph over
the jagged rim. Power lay in the  brown swell of his forearms: authority sat
on his shoulder and chattered in his ear like an ape.
"All sit down."
The boy s ranged  themselves in rows on the grass before him b ut Ralph
and Piggy stayed a foot lower , s tanding on the soft sand. Jack ignored them
for the moment, turned his mas k down to the seated boys and pointed at
them with the spear .
"Who's going to join my tribe?"
