Eric felt his face.
"I'm all rough. Am I bleeding?"
The circle of bo ys shrank away in horror . Johnny , yawning s till, burst
into noisy tears and was slapped by Bill till he choked on them. The bright
morning was full of threats and  the circle began to change. It faced out,
rather than in, a nd the spears of sharpened wood were like a fence. Jack
called them back to the center .
"This'll be a real hunt! Who'll come?"
Ralph moved impatiently .
"These spears are made of wood. Don't be silly ."
Jack sneered at him.
"Frightened?"
"'Course I'm frightened. Who wouldn't be?"
He turned to the twins, yearning but hopeless.
"I suppose you aren't pulling our legs?"
The reply was too emphatic for anyone to doubt them.
Piggy took the conch.
"Couldn't we―kind of―stay here? Maybe the beast won't come near us."
But for the se nse of something watching them, Ralph would have
shouted at him.
"Stay here? And be cramped into this bit of the island, always on the
lookout? How should we get our food? And what about the fire?"
"Let's be moving," said Jack relentlessly , "we're wasting time."
