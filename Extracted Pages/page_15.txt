Because, thoug ht Ralph, because, because. The roar from the reef
became very distant.
"They'd tell him at the airport."
Piggy sh ook his  head, put on his flashing glasses and looked  down at
Ralph.
"Not them. Didn't you hear what the pilot said? About the atom bomb?
They're all dead."
Ralph pulled himself out of the water , stood facing Piggy , and c onsidered
this unusual problem.
Piggy persisted.
"This an island, isn't it?"
"I climbed a rock," said Ralph slowly , "and I think this is an island."
"They're all dead," said Piggy , "an' this is an island. Nobody do n't know
we're here. Y our dad don't know , nobody don't know―"
His lips quivered and the spectacles were dimmed with mist.
"W e may stay here till we die."
W ith tha t word the heat seemed to increase till it became a threatening
weight and the lagoon attacked them with a blinding ef fulgence.
"Get my clothes," muttered Ralph. "Along there."
He trott ed through the sand, enduring the sun's enmity , crossed the
platform and found his scattered  clothes. T o put on a grey shirt once more
was strangely pleasing. Then he  climbed the edge of the platform and sat in
the green shade on a convenient trunk. Piggy hauled himself up, carrying
most of his clothes under his arms. Then he sat carefully on a fallen trunk
near the little c lif f that fronted the lagoon; and the tangled  reflections
quivered over him.
