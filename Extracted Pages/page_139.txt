"I hit him," said Ralph indignan tly . "I hit him with my spear , I wounded
him."
He tried for their attention.
"He was coming along the path. I threw , like this―"
Robert snarled at him. Ralph entered into the play and e verybody
laughed. Presently they were all jabbing at Robert who made mock rushes.
Jack shouted.
"Make a ring!"
The circle moved in and round. Robert squealed in mock terror , then in
real pain.
"Ow! Stop it! Y ou're hurting!"
The butt end of a spear fell on his back as he blundered among them.
"Hold him!"
They got his a rms and legs. R alph, carried away by a sudd en thick
excitement, grabbed Eric's spear and jabbed at Robert with it.
"Kill him! Kill him!"
All at once, Ro bert was screaming and struggling with the strength of
frenzy . Jack had him by the hair  and was brandishing his knife. Behind him
was Roger , fighting to get close. The chant rose ritually , as at the last
moment of a dance or a hunt.
" Kill the pig! Cut his thr oat! Kill the pig! Bash him in! "
Ralph to o was fighting to get  near , to get a handful of tha t brown,
vulnerable flesh. The desire to squeeze and hurt was over -mastering.
