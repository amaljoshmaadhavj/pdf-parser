Ralph made a sudden movement that became a stumble. Som e of the
boys turned toward him.
"I ga ve you foo d," said Jack, "a nd my hunters will protect you from the
beast. Who will join my tribe?"
"I'm chief," said Ralph, "because you chose me. And we were going to
keep the fire going. Now you run after food―"
"Y ou ran yourself!" shouted Jack. "Look at that bone in your hands!"
Ralph went crimson.
"I said you were hunters. That was your job."
Jack ignored him again.
"Who'll join my tribe and have fun?"
"I'm chi ef," said  Ralph tremulously . "And what about the fire? And I've
got the conch― "Y ou haven't go t it with you," said Jack, sneering. "Y ou left
it behind. See, clever? And the conch doesn't count at this end of the
island―"
All a t on ce the thunder struck. Instead of the dull boom there w as a point
of impact in the explosion.
"The conch counts here too," said Ralph, "and all over the island."
"What are you going to do about it then?"
Ralph examined  the ranks of boys. There was no help in them  and he
looked away , confused and sweating. Piggy whispered.
"The fire―rescue."
"Who'll join my tribe?"
"I will."
