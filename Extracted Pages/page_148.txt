Irritably Ralph shook himself. This was all Jack's fault.
"'Course I am. But we're still being fools."
"If you don't want to go on," s aid the voice sarcastically , "I'll go up by
myself."
Ralph h eard the  mockery and hated Jack. The sting of ashes in his eyes,
tiredness, fear , enraged him.
"Go on then! W e'll wait here."
There was silence.
"Why don't you go? Are you fri ghtened?" A stain in the darkness, a stain
that was Jack, detached itself and began to draw away .
"All right. So long."
The stain vanished. Another took its place.
Ralph felt his k nee against something hard and rocked a charred trunk
that was edgy to the touch. He felt the sharp cinders that had been bark push
against the back of his knee and knew that Roger had sat down. He felt with
his hands and lo wered himself beside Roger , while the trunk rocked among
invisible ashes. Roger , uncommunicative by nature, said nothing. He
of fered no opinion on the beast nor told Ralph why he had chosen to come
on this mad expedition. He simply sat and rocked the trunk ge ntly . Ralph
noticed a rapid and infuriating tapping noise and realized that Roger was
banging his silly wooden stick against something.
So they sat, the rocking, tapping, impervious Roger and Ralph, fuming;
round them the close sky was loaded with stars, save where the mountain
punched up a hole of blackness.
There w as a slithering noise high above them, the sound of someone
taking g iant and  dangerous strides on rock or ash. Then Jack f ound them,
and was shivering and croaking in a voice they could just recognize as his.
