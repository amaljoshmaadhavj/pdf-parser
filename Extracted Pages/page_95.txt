"Then there's huts. Shelters."
The murmur swelled again and died away .
"Y ou mostly sleep in shelters. T onight, except for Samneric u p by the
fire, you'll all sleep there. Who built the shelters?"
Clamor rose at o nce. Everyone had built the shelters. Ralph had to wave
the conch once more.
"W ait a minute! I mean, who built all three? W e all built the first one,
four of us the second one, and me 'n Simon built the last one over there.
That's why it's so tottery . No.
Don't laugh. That shelter might fall down if the rain comes back. W e'll
need those shelters then."
He paused and cleared his throat.
"There's another thing. W e chose those rocks right along beyond the
bathing pool as a lavatory . That  was sensible too. The tide cleans the place
up. Y ou littluns know about that."
There were sniggers here and there and swift glances.
"Now p eople seem to use anywhere. Even near the shelters  and the
platform. Y ou littluns, when you're getting fruit; if you're taken short―"
The assembly roared.
"I said if you're taken short you keep away from the fruit. That's dirty!"
Laughter rose again.
"I said that's dirty!"
He plucked at his stif f, grey shirt.
