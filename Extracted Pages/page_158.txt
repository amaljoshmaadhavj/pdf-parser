need to stay close to the platf orm; there'll be less need of him and his
hunting. So now we can really decide on what's what."
"There's no help, Piggy . Nothing to be done."

the conc h from Piggy , who was  so astonished that he remained  on his feet.
Ralph looked up at Simon.
"Simon? What is it this time?"
A half-sound of jeering ran round the circle and Simon shrank from it.
"I thought there might be something to do. Something we-"
Again the pressure of the assembly took his voice away . He sought for
help and  sympa thy and chose P iggy . He turned half toward him, clutching
the conch to his brown chest.
"I think we ought to climb the mountain."
The circ le shive red with dread. S imon broke of f and turned to Piggy who
was looking at him with an expression of derisive incomprehension.
"What's the good of climbing up to this here beast when Ralph and the
other two couldn't do nothing?"
Simon whispered his answer .
"What else is there to do?"
His spee ch made, he allowed P iggy to lift the conch out of h is hands.
Then he retired and sat as far away from the others as possible.
Piggy was speaking now with  more assurance and with what, if the
circumstances had not been so s erious, the others would have re cognized as
pleasure.
