"All you littluns, go to sleep. W e've had a fight with the others. Now go
to sleep."
      Samneric came close and peered at Ralph.
"Are you two all right?"
"I think so―"
"―I got busted."
"So did I. How's Piggy?"
They ha uled Pig gy clear of the wreckage and leaned him again st a tree.
The nigh t was cool and pur ged o f immediate terror . Piggy's breathing was a
little easier .
"Did you get hurt, Piggy?"
"Not much."
"That w as Jack and his hunter s," said Ralph bitterly . "Why can't they
leave us alone?"
"W e gav e them something to thi nk about," said Sam. Honesty compelled
him to go on. "At least you did. I got mixed up with myself in a corner ."
"I ga ve one of 'em what for ," said Ralph, "I smashed him up all right. He
won't want to come and fight us again in a hurry ."
"So did I," said Eric. "When I woke up one was kicking me in the face. I
got an awful bloody face, I think, Ralph. But I did him in the end."
"What did you do?"
"I got my knee up," said Eric with simple pride, "and I hit him with it in
the p ills. Y ou should have heard  him holler! He won't come back in a hurry
either . So we didn't do too badly ."
