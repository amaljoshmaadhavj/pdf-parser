"There w as a ship. Out there. Y o u said you'd keep the fire going and you
let it out!" He took a step toward Jack, who turned and faced him.
"They might have seen us. W e might have gone home―"
This was too bitter for Piggy , who for got his timidity in the agony of his
loss. He began to cry out, shrilly:
"Y ou and your b lood, Jack Merridew! Y ou and your hunting! W e might
have gone home―"
Ralph pushed Piggy to one side.
"I w as chief, an d you were going to do what I said. Y ou talk. But you
can't even build huts―then you go of f hunting and let out the fire―"
He turned away , silent for a m oment. Then his voice came ag ain on a
peak of feeling.
"There was a ship―"
One of the smaller hunters began to wail. The dismal truth was filtering
through to everybody . Jack went very red as he hacked and p ulled at the
pig.
"The job was too much. W e needed everyone."
Ralph turned.
"Y ou could have had everyone when the shelters were finished . But you
had to hunt―"
"W e needed meat."
Jack sto od up as he said this, t he bloodied knife in his hand.  The two
boys faced each other . There w as the brilliant world of hunting, tactics,
fierce exhilarati on, skill; and there was the world of longing and baf fled
commonsense. Jack transferred the knife to his left hand an d smudged
blood over his forehead as he pushed down the plastered hair .
