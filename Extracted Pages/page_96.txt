"That's really dirty . If you're tak en short you go right along the beach to
the rocks. See?"
Piggy h eld out his hands for the conch but Ralph shook his h ead. His
speech was planned, point by point.
"W e've all got t o use the rocks  again. This place is getting dirty ." He
paused. The assembly , sensing a crisis, was tensely expectant. "And then:
about the fire."
Ralph le t out his spare breath w ith a little gasp that was echoed by his
audience. Jack started to chip a piece of wood with his knife and whispered
something to Robert, who looked away .
"The fire is the most important thing on the island. How can we ever be
rescued except by luck, if we don't keep a fire going? Is a fire too much for
us to make?"
He flung out an arm.
"Look at us! How many are we? And yet we can't keep a fire going to
make smoke. Don't you understand? Can't you see we ought to―ought to
die before we let the fire out?"
      There was a  self-conscious giggling among the hunters. Ralph turned
on them passionately .
"Y ou hu nters! Y ou can laugh! But I tell you the smoke is more important
than the pig, however often you kill one. Do all of you see?" H e spread his
arms wide and turned to the whole triangle.
"W e've got to make smoke up there―or die."
He paused, feeling for his next point.
"And another thing."
Someone called out.
