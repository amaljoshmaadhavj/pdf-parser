Stillness descen ded on them. Ralph, looking with more understanding at
Piggy , saw that he was hurt a nd crushed. He hovered between the two
courses of apology or further insult.
"Better Piggy than Fatty ," he said at last, with the directness of genuine
leadership, "and anyway , I'm sorry if you feel like that. Now go back,

had to laugh again.

block sitting out in the lagoon. Sea birds were nesting there.
"Like icing," said Ralph, "on a pink cake."
"W e sha n't see round this corn er ," said Jack, "because there isn't one.
Only a slow curve―and you can see, the rocks get worse―"
