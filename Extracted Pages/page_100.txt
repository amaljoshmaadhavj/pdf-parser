"W e eat pig."
"Piggy!"
"I got the conch!" said Piggy i ndignantly . "Ralph― they ought to shut
up, oughtn't they? Y ou shut up, you littluns! What I mean is that I don't
agree ab out this here fear . Of co urse there isn't nothing to be afraid of in the
forest. W hy―I been there myself! Y ou'll be talking about ghosts and such
things next. W e know what goes on and if there's something wrong, there's
someone to put it right."
He t ook of f his glasses and blinked at them. The sun had gone as if the
light had been turned of f.
He proceeded to explain.
"If you get a pain in your stomach, whether it's a little one or a big
one―"
"Y ours is a big one."
"When y ou don e laughing perhaps we can get on with the mee ting. And
if th em littluns climb back on the twister again they'll only fall of f in a sec.
So they might as  well sit on the ground and listen. No. Y ou have  doctors for
everything, even  the inside of your mind. Y ou don't really mean that we got
to be frightened all the time of nothing? Life," said Piggy expansively , "is
scientific, that's what it is. In a year or two when the war's ov er they'll be
traveling to Mars and back. I kn ow there isn't no beast―not with claws and
all that, I mean―but I know there isn't no fear , either ."
Piggy paused.
"Unless―"
Ralph moved restlessly .
"Unless what?"
"Unless we get frightened of people."
