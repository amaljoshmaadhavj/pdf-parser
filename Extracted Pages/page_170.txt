"Where's Samneric?"
"W e ought to get some more wood. W e're out of green branches."
Ralph sighed and stood up. There were no shadows under the palms on
the p latform; only this strange l ight that seemed to come from everywhere
at once. High up among the bulging clouds thunder went of f like a gun.
"W e're going to get buckets of rain."
"What about the fire?"
Ralph tr otted in to the forest an d returned with a wide spray of green
which he dumped on the fire. The branch crackled, the leaves curled and the
yellow smoke expanded.
Piggy made an aimless little pattern in the sand with his fingers.
"T rouble is, we haven't got enough people for a fire. Y ou go t to treat
Samnenc as one turn. They do everything together―"
"Of course."
"W ell, that isn't fair . Don't you see? They ought to do two turns."
Ralph co nsidered this and understood. He was vexed to find how little he
thought like a gr ownup and sighed again. The island was getting worse and
worse.
Piggy looked at the fire.
"Y ou'll want another green branch soon."
Ralph rolled over .
"Piggy . What are we going to do?"
"Just have to get on without 'em."
