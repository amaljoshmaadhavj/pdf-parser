Ralph continued to snigger though his chest hurt. His twitchings
exhausted him till he lay , breat hless and woebegone, waiting for the next
spasm. During one of these pauses he was ambushed by sleep.
"Ralph! Y ou been making a noise again. Do be quiet, Ralph―because."
Ralph heaved over among the leaves. He had reason to be thankful that
his dream was broken, for the bus had been nearer and more distinct.
"Why―because?"
"Be quiet―and listen."
Ralph la y down  carefully , to the  accompaniment of a long sigh  from the
leaves. Eric moaned something and then lay still. The darkness, save for the
useless oblong of stars, was blanket-thick.
"I can't hear anything."
"There's something moving outside."
Ralph's head prickled. The soun d of his blood drowned all else and then
subsided.
"I still can't hear anything."
"Listen. Listen for a long time."
Quite clearly and emphatically , and only a yard or so away from the back
of th e shelter , a  stick cracked. The blood roared again in R alph's ears,
confused images  chased each ot her through his mind. A compo site of these
things was prowling round the s helters. He could feel Piggy's h ead against
his shoulder and the convulsive grip of a hand.
"Ralph! Ralph!"
"Shut up and listen."
Desperately , Ralph prayed that the beast would prefer littluns.
