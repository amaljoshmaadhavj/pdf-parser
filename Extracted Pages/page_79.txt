He turned round and peered u p at the mountain. Ralph con tinued to
watch th e ship, ravenously . Color was coming back into his face. Simon
stood by him, silent.
"I k now I can' t see very muc h," said Piggy , "but have we got any
smoke?"
Ralph moved impatiently , still watching the ship.
"The smoke on the mountain."
Maurice came running, and stared out to sea. Both Simon and Piggy were
looking up at the mountain. Piggy screwed up his face but Simon cried out
as though he had hurt himself.
"Ralph! Ralph!"
The quality of his speech twisted Ralph on the sand.
"Y ou tell me," said Piggy anxiously . "Is there a signal?"
Ralph looked back at the dispersing smoke in the horizon, then up at the
mountain.
"Ralph―please! Is there a signal?"
Simon put out h is hand, timidly , to touch Ralph; but Ralph started to run,
splashing through the shallow end of the bathing pool, across the hot, white
sand and  under the palms. A moment later he was battling with t he complex
under growth that was already engulfing the scar . Simon ran after him, then
Maurice. Piggy shouted.
"Ralph! Please―Ralph!"
Then he too sta rted to run, stumbling over Maurice's discarded shorts
before h e was across the terrace. Behind the four boys, the sm oke moved
gently along the horizon; and on the beach, Henry and Jo hnny were
throwing sand at Percival who was crying quietly again; and all three were
in complete ignorance of the excitement.
