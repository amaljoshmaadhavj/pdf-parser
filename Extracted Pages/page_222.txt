Their spears were taken from them.
"T ie them up!"
Ralph cried out hopelessly against the black and green mask.
"Jack!"
"Go on. T ie them."
Now the painted group felt the otherness of Samneric, felt the power in
their ow n hands. They felled t he twins clumsily and excitedly . Jack was
inspired. He knew that Ralph would attempt a rescue. He struck in a
humming circle behind him and  Ralph only just parried the blow . Beyond
them the  tribe and the twins were a loud and writhing heap. Piggy crouched
again. Then the twins lay , astonished, and the tribe stood round them. Jack
turned to Ralph and spoke between his teeth.
"See? They do what I want."
There w as silen ce again. The tw ins lay , inexpertly tied up, and  the tribe
watched Ralph to see what he would do. He numbered them through his
fringe, glimpsed the inef fectual smoke.
His temper broke. He screamed at Jack.
"Y ou're a beast and a swine and a bloody , bloody thief!"
He char ged.
Jack, kn owing this was the crisis, char ged too. They met with a jolt and
bounced apart. Jack swung with his fist at Ralph and caught him on the ear .
Ralph hit Jack i n the stomach a nd made him grunt. Then they were facing
each oth er again , panting and fu rious, but unnerved by each other's ferocity .
They became aware of the noise that was the background to this fight, the
steady shrill cheering of the tribe behind them.
Piggy's voice penetrated to Ralph.
