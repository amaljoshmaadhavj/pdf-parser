"I hit him all right. The spear stuck in. I wounded him!"
He sunned himself in their new respect and felt that hunting was good
after all.
"I walloped him properly . That was the beast, I think!" Jack came back.
"That wasn't the beast. That was a boar ."
"I hit him."
"Why didn't you grab him? I tried―"
Ralph's voice ran up.
"But a boar!"
Jack flushed suddenly .
"Y ou sa id he'd do us. What did  you want to throw for? Why d idn't you
wait?
He held out his arm.
"Look."
He t urned his le ft forearm for them all to see. On the outside was a rip;
not much, but bloody .
"He did that with his tusks. I couldn't get my spear down in time."
Attention focused on Jack.
"That's a wound," said Simon, "and you ought to suck it. Like
Berengaria."
Jack sucked.
