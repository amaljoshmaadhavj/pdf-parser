and ther e was the glitter of wate r . Then he was down, rolling over and over
in the warm sand, crouching with arm to ward of f, trying to cry for mercy .
He s taggered to his feet, tensed for more terrors, and looked up at a huge
peaked cap. It w as a white-topped cap, and above the green shade of the
peak wa s a crown, an anchor , gold foliage. He saw white drill, epaulettes, a
revolver , a row of gilt buttons down the front of a uniform.
A n aval of ficer stood on the sand, looking down at Ralph in wary
astonishment. O n the beach beh ind him was a cutter , her bows hauled up
and held by tw o ratings. In th e stern-sheets another rating held a sub-
machine gun.
The ululation faltered and died away .
The of fi cer look ed at Ralph dou btfully for a moment, then took  his hand
away from the butt of the revolver .
"Hullo."
Squirming a little, conscious o f his filthy appearance, Ralph answered
shyly .
"Hullo."
The of ficer nodded, as if a question had been answered.
"Are there any adults―any grownups with you?"
Dumbly , Ralph shook his head. He turned a halfpace on the sand. A
semicircle of little boys, their bodies streaked with colored clay , sharp sticks
in their hands, were standing on the beach making no noise at all.
"Fun and games," said the of ficer .
The fire reached the coconut palms by the beach and swallowed them
noisily . A flame, seemingly detached, swung like an acrobat an d licked up
the palm heads on the platform. The sky was black.
