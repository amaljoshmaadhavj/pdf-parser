"The thi ng is― fear can't hurt y ou any more than a dream. There aren't
any bea sts to be afraid of on this island." He looked along the row of
whispering littluns. "Serve you right if something did get you, you useless
lot of cry-babies! But there is no animal―"
Ralph interrupted him testily .
"What is all this? Who said anything about an animal?"
"Y ou di d, the other day . Y ou s aid they dream and cry out. Now they
talk―not only the littluns, but my hunters sometimes―talk of a thing, a
dark thing, a beast, some sort of animal. I've heard. Y ou thought not, didn't
you? No w listen. Y ou don't get big animals on small islands. Only pigs. Y ou
only get lions and tigers in big countries like Africa and India―"
"And the Zoo―"
"I've got the con ch. I'm not talking about the fear . I'm talking about the
beast. Be frightened if you like. But as for the beast―"
Jack pau sed, cra dling the conch, and turned to his hunters with t heir dirty
black caps.
"Am I a hunter or am I not?"
They nodded, simply . He was a hunter all right. No one doubted that.
"W ell then―I've been all over this island. By myself. If there were a
beast I'd have seen it. Be frightened because you're like that―but there is
no beast in the forest."
Jack ha nded back the conch and sat down. The whole assembly
applauded him with relief. Then Piggy held out his hand.
"I don't agree wi th all Jack said,  but with some. 'Course there isn't a beast
in the forest. How could there be? What would a beast eat?"
"Pig."
