silence a nd heat. Under the tree s an ear flapped idly . A little ap art from the
rest, sunk in deep maternal blis s, lay the lar gest sow of the l ot. She was
black an d pink; and the great bla dder of her belly was fringed with a row of
piglets that slept or burrowed and squeaked.
Fifteen yards from the drove J ack stopped, and his arm, strai ghtening,
pointed at the sow . He looked round in inquiry to make sure th at everyone
understood and the other boys nodded at him. The row of right arms slid
back.
"Now!"
The drov e of pigs started up; an d at a range of only ten yards the wooden
spears w ith fire-hardened point s flew toward the chosen pig. One piglet,
with a demented shriek, rushed into the sea trailing Roger's spear behind it.
The sow gave a gasping squeal and staggered up, with two spears sticking
in her fat flank. The boys shouted and rushed forward, the piglets scattered
and the sow burst the advancing line and went crashing away through the
forest.
"After her!"
They raced along the pig-track, but the forest was too dark and t angled so
that Jack , cursin g, stopped them and cast among the trees. Then he said
nothing for a time but breathed fiercely so that they were awed by him and
looked at each other in uneasy admiration. Presently he stabbed down at the
ground with his finger .
"There―"
Before the others could examine the drop of blood, Jack had swerved of f,
judging a trace, touching a bou gh that gave. So he followed, mysteriously
right and assured, and the hunters trod behind him.
He stopped before a covert.
"In there."
