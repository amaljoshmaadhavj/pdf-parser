"W ell, Piggy?"
"There was another one. Him."
The littluns pushed Percival for ward, then left him by himself. He stood
knee-deep in the central grass, looking at his hidden feet, trying to pretend
he w as i n a tent. Ralph remembered another small boy who ha d stood like
this and  he flinched away from the memory . He had pushed the thought
down an d out of sight, where o nly some positive reminder like this could
bring it to the su rface. There had been no further numberings of  the littluns,
partly because there was no means of insuring that all of them were
accounted for and partly because Ralph knew the answer to at least one
question Piggy had asked on the mountaintop. There were littl e boys, fair ,
dark, fre ckled, and all dirty , but their faces were all dreadfully fr ee of major
blemishes. No one had seen the mulberry-colored birthmark aga in. But that
time Pig gy had coaxed and bul lied. T acitly admitting that he remembered
the unmentionable, Ralph nodded to Piggy .
"Go on. Ask him."
Piggy knelt, holding the conch.
"Now then. What's your name?"
The sma ll boy twisted away i nto his tent. Piggy turned helplessly to
Ralph, who spoke sharply .
"What's your name?"
T ormented by the silence and the refusal the assembly broke into a chant.
"What's your name? What's your name?"
"Quiet!"
Ralph peered at the child in the twilight.
"Now tell us. What's your name?"
