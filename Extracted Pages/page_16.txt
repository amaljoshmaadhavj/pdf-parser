"W e got to find the others. W e got to do something."
Ralph said nothing. Here was a coral island. Protected from  the sun,
ignoring Piggy's ill-omened talk, he dreamed pleasantly .
Piggy insisted.
"How many of us are there?"
Ralph came forward and stood by Piggy .
"I don't know ."
Here and there, little breezes crept over the polished waters beneath the
haze of heat. When these breezes reached the platform the palm fronds
would w hisper , so that spots of  blurred sunlight slid over the ir bodies or
moved like bright, winged things in the shade.
Piggy looked up at Ralph. All the shadows on Ralph's face were
reversed; green above, bright be low from the lagoon. A blur of s unlight was
crawling across his hair .
"W e got to do something."
Ralph lo oked th rough him. Here at last was the imagined but n ever fully
realized place leaping into real life. Ralph's lips parted in a deli ghted smile
and Piggy , taking this smile to himself as a mark of recognition, laughed
with pleasure.
"If it really is an island―"
"What's that?"
Ralph h ad stopped smiling and was pointing into the lagoon. Something
creamy lay among the ferny weeds.
"A stone."
