"I saw a thing on top."
They heard him blunder against  the trunk which rocked violentl y . He lay
silent for a moment, then muttered.
"Keep a good lookout. It may be following."
A shower of ash pattered round them. Jack sat up.
"I saw a thing bulge on the mountain."
"Y ou on ly imagined it," said Ralph shakily , "because nothing would
bulge. Not any sort of creature."
Roger spoke; they jumped, for they had for gotten him.
"A frog."
Jack giggled and shuddered.
"Some f rog. The re was a noise too. A kind of 'plop' noise. Then the thing
bulged."
Ralph su rprised himself, not so much by the quality of his voic e, which
was even, but by the bravado of its intention.
"W e'll go and look."
For the first time since he had first known Jack, Ralph could  feel him
hesitate.
"Now―?"
His voice spoke for him.
"Of course."
He g ot of f the trunk and led the  way across the clinking cinder s up into
the dark, and the others followed.
