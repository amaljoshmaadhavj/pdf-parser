visible. He put the spear down again.
"Heave! Heave! Heave!"
A shrill, prolonged cheer .
Something boom ed up on the red rock, then the earth jumped a nd began
to shake steadily , while the noise as steadily increased. Ralph was shot into
the air , thrown down, dashed ag ainst branches. At his right hand, and only a
few feet away , t he whole thicket bent and the roots screamed as they came
out of the earth together . He saw  something red that turned over  slowly as a
mill wheel. Then the red thin g was past and the elephanti ne progress
diminished toward the sea.
Ralph knelt on t he plowed-up soil, and waited for the earth to co me back.
Presently the white, broken stu mps, the split sticks and the tangle of the
thicket refocuse d. There was a kind of heavy feeling in his body where he
had watched his own pulse.
Silence again.
Y et not entirely so. They were whispering out there; and suddenly the
branches were shaken furiously at two places on his right. The pointed end
of a  stic k appeared. In panic, Ralph thrust his own stick throug h the crack
and struck with all his might.
"Aaa-ah!"
His spear twisted a little in his hands and then he withdrew it again.
"Ooh-ooh―"
Someone was moaning outside and a babble of voices rose.  A fierce
ar gument was going on and the wounded savage kept groaning. Then when
there was silence, a single voic e spoke and Ralph decided that it was not
Jack's.
"See? I told you―he's dangerous."
