Now the fire wa s nearer; those volleying shots were great limb s, trunks
even, bursting. The fools! The fools! The fire must be almost at the fruit
trees―what would they eat tomorrow?
Ralph st irred restlessly in his n arrow bed. One chanced nothing! What
could th ey do? Beat him? So what? Kill him? A stick sharpened at both
ends.
The crie s, sudde nly nearer , jerked him up. He could see a stripe d savage
moving hastily out of a green ta ngle, and coming toward the m at where he
hid, a savage wh o carried a spear . Ralph gripped his fingers in to the earth.
Be ready now , in case.
Ralph fu mbled t o hold his spear so that it was point foremost; and now
he saw that the stick was sharpened at both ends.
The savage stopped fifteen yards away and uttered his cry .
Perhaps he can hear my heart over the noises of the fire. Don't scream.
Get ready .
The savage moved forward so th at you could only see him from the waist

down. Don't scream.
A he rd o f pigs came squealing out of the greenery behind the savage and
rushed away into the forest. Bi rds were screaming, mice shrieking, and a
little hopping thing came under the mat and cowered.
Five yards away the savage stopped, standing right by the thicket, and
cried ou t. Ralph drew his feet up and crouched. The stake was i n his hands,
the stake  sharpe ned at both ends, the stake that vibrated so wildly , that grew
long, short, light, heavy , light again.
The ululation spread from shore to shore. The savage knelt down by the
edge of the thick et, and there we re lights flickering in the forest behind him.
Y ou could see a knee disturb the mold. Now the other . T wo hands. A spear .
