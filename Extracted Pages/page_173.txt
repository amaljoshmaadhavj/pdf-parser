together round a palm tree at the edge of the forest. A littlun howled,
creased and crimson, by the bathing pool and Piggy stood on the platform,
the white conch gripped in his hands.
"T onight we're having a feast. W e've killed a pig and we've got m eat. Y ou
can come and eat with us if you like."
Up in the cloud canyons the thunder boomed again. Jack and the two
anonymous savages with him swayed, looking up, and then recovered. The
littlun went on howling. Jack was waiting for something. He whispered
ur gently to the others.
"Go on―now!"
The two savages murmured. Jack spoke sharply .
"Go on!"
The two  savages looked at each other , raised their spears together and
spoke in time.
"The Chief has spoken."
Then the  three of them turned a nd trotted away . Presently Ralph rose to
his f eet, looking at the place where the savages had vanished . Samneric
came, talking in an awed whisper .
"I thought it was―"
"―and I was―"
"―scared."
Piggy stood above them on the platform, still holding the conch.
"That w as Jack and Maurice and Robert," said Ralph. "Aren't they having
fun?"
"I thought I was going to have asthma."
