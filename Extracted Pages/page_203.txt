"All right?"
"S'pose so."
At length, save for an occasional rustle, the shelter was silent. An oblong
of b lackness relieved with brill iant spangles hung before them and there
was the  hollow sound of surf on the reef. Ralph settled himself for his
nightly game of supposing....
Supposing they could be transported home by jet, then before morning
they wo uld land at that big airfield in W iltshire. They would go by car; no,
for things to be perfect they would go by train; all the way down to Devon
and take that cottage again. The n at the foot of the garden the wild ponies
would come and look over the wall....
Ralph tu rned res tlessly in the le aves. Dartmoor was wild and so  were the
ponies. But the attraction of wildness had gone.
His mind skated to a consider ation of a tamed town where savagery
could not set foot. What could be safer than the bus center with its lamps
and wheels?
All a t on ce, Ralph was dancing round a lamp standard. There w as a bus
crawling out of the bus station, a strange bus....
"Ralph! Ralph!"
"What is it?"
"Don't make a noise like that―"
"Sorry ."
From the darkness of the further end of the shelter came a  dreadful
moaning and they shattered the leaves in their fear . Sam and Eric, locked in
an embrace, were fighting each other .
"Sam! Sam!"
