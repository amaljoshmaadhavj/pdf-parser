"Oh yes. W ithout the fire we can't be rescued. So we must stay by the fire
and make smoke."
When he stopped no one said anything. After the many brilliant  speeches
that had been m ade on this very  spot Ralph's remarks seemed lame, even to
the littluns.
At last Bill held out his hands for the conch.
"Now we can't h ave the fire up there―because we can't have the fire up
there―we need more people to keep it going. Let's go to this feast and tell
them the  fire's hard on the rest  of us. And the hunting and all  that, being
savages I mean―it must be jolly good fun."
Samneric took the conch.
"That must be fun like Bill says―and as he's invited us―"
"―to a feast―"
"―meat―"
"―crackling―"
"―I could do with some meat―"
Ralph held up his hand. "Why shouldn't we get our own meat?" The
twins lo oked at each other . Bi ll answered. "W e don't want t o go in the
jungle." Ralph grimaced. "He―you know―goes."
"He's a hunter . They're all hunters. That's dif ferent." No one spoke for a
moment, then Piggy muttered to the sand. "Meat―"
The littluns sat, solemnly thinki ng of meat, and dribbling. Ove rhead the
cannon boomed again and the d ry palm fronds clattered in a sudden gust of
hot wind.
"Y ou are a silly  little boy ," said  the Lord of the Flies, "just an ignorant,
silly little boy ."
