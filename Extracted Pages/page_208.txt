Ralph m oved su ddenly in the d ark; but then he heard Eric working his
mouth.
"What's the matter?"
"Jus' a tooth loose."
Piggy drew up his legs.
"Y ou all right, Piggy?"
"I thought they wanted the conch."
Ralph tr otted do wn the pale be ach and jumped on to the platform. The
conch still glimmered by the ch ief's seat. He gazed for a moment or two,
then went back to Piggy .
"They didn't take the conch."
"I know . They didn't come for the conch. They came for something else.
Ralph―what am I going to do?"
Far of f along th e bowstave of beach, three figures trotted toward the
Castle Rock. They kept away from the forest and down by the water .
Occasionally the y sang softly; o ccasionally they turned cartwhe els down by
the m oving streak of phosphore scence. The chief led then, trott ing steadily ,
exulting in his achievement. He was a chief now in truth; an d he made
stabbing motion s with his spear . From his left hand dangled Piggy's broken
glasses.
