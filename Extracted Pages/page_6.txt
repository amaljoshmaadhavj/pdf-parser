CHAPTER ONE
     
The Sound of the Shell
     
The boy  with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and
began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken of f his
school s weater and trailed it now  from one hand, his grey shirt s tuck to him
and his hair was plastered to h is forehead. All round him the long scar
smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clamber ing heavily
among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and
yellow , flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by
another .
"Hi!" it said. "W ait a minute!"
The under growth at the side of  the scar was shaken and a multitude of
raindrops fell pattering.
"W ait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."
The fair  boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture
that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.
The voice spoke again.
"I can't hardly move with all these creeper things."
The ow ner of the voice came backing out of the under growth so that
twigs scratched on a greasy wi nd-breaker . The naked crooks of his knees
were plu mp, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the
thorns c arefully , and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and
very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and
then looked up through thick spectacles.
