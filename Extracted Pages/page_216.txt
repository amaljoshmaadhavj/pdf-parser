"What are we hiding for?"
He s tepped through the screen o f grass on to the little open spac e that led
to the narrow neck.
"Y ou tw o follow behind. I'll go first, then Piggy a pace behind me. Keep
your spears ready ."
Piggy pe ered anxiously into the luminous veil that hung between  him and
the world.
"Is it safe? Ain't there a clif f? I can hear the sea."
"Y ou keep right close to me."
Ralph moved forward on to the neck. He kicked a stone and it bounded
into the water . Then the sea su cked down, revealing a red, w eedy square
forty feet beneath Ralph's left arm.
"Am I safe?" quavered Piggy . "I feel awful―"
High above them from the pinnacles came a sudden shout and then an
imitation war -cry that was answered by a dozen voices from  behind the
rock.
"Give me the conch and stay still."
"Halt! Who goes there?"
Ralph bent back his head and glimpsed Roger's dark face at the top.
"Y ou can see who I am!" he shouted. "Stop being silly!"
He put the conch to his lips and began to blow . Savages appeared,
painted out of r ecognition, edgi ng round the ledge toward the neck. They
carried s pears and disposed themselves to defend the entrance. Ralph went
on blowing and ignored Piggy's terrors.
Roger was shouting.
