As the fire died down so did the excitement. The littluns stopped singing
and dancing and drifted away toward the sea or the fruit trees or the
shelters.
Ralph dropped down in the sand.
"W e'll have to make a new list of who's to look after the fire."
"If you can find 'em."
He l ooked round. Then for the first time he saw how few biguns there
were and understood why the work had been so hard.
"Where's Maurice?"
Piggy wiped his glass again.
"I expect... no, he wouldn't go into the forest by himself, would he?"
Ralph ju mped u p, ran swiftly ro und the fire and stood by Piggy , holding
up his hair .
"But we've got to have a list! There's you and me and Samneric and―"
He would not look at Piggy but spoke casually .
"Where's Bill and Roger?"
Piggy leaned forward and put a fragment of wood on the fire.
"I expect they've gone. I expect they won't play either ."
Ralph sat down and began to poke little holes in the sand. He was
surprised to see that one had a drop of blood by it. He examined his bitten
nail clos ely and  watched the lit tle globe of blood that gathere d where the
quick was gnawed away .
Piggy went on speaking.
