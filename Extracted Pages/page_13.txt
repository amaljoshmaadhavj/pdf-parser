"Whizzoh!"
Beyond the platform there was more enchantment. Some act of God―a
typhoon perhaps, or the storm t hat had accompanied his own arrival―had
banked sand inside the lagoon so that there was a long, deep pool in the
beach with a high ledge of pink granite at the further end. Ralph had been
deceived before  now by the specious appearance of depth in a beach pool
and he approach ed this one prep aring to be disappointed. But th e island ran
true to form and  the incredible pool, which clearly was only inv aded by the
sea at high tide, was so deep at one end as to be dark green. Ralph inspected
the whole thirty yards carefully and then plunged in. The water was warmer
than his blood and he might have been swimming in a huge bath.
Piggy appeared again, sat on the rocky ledge, and watched Ralph's green
and white body enviously .
"Y ou can't half swim."
"Piggy ."
Piggy took of f his shoes and socks, ranged them carefully on the ledge,
and tested the water with one toe.
"It's hot!"
"What did you expect?"
"I didn't expect nothing. My auntie―"
"Sucks to your auntie!"
Ralph did a surface dive and swam under water with his eyes open; the
sandy edge of the pool loomed up like a hillside. He turned over , holding
his n ose, and a golden light danced and shattered just over his  face. Piggy
was look ing det ermined and began to take of f his shorts. Presently he was
palely and fatly naked. He tiptoed down the sandy side of the pool, and sat
there up to his neck in water smiling proudly at Ralph.
"Aren't you going to swim?"
