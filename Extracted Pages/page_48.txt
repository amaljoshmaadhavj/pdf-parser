Jack grinned back.
"Not for the two of us."
T ogether , joined  in an ef fort by the burden, they staggered up the last
steep O f the mountain. T ogether , they chanted One! T wo! Three! and
crashed the log on to the great p ile. Then they stepped back, la ughing with
triumphant pleasure, so that immediately Ralph had to stand o n his head.
Below them, boys were still laboring, though some of the small ones had
lost interest and were searching this new forest for fruit. Now the twins,
with uns uspected intelligence, c ame up the mountain with armfuls of dried
leaves and dumped them agains t the pile. One by one, as they  sensed that
the pile was complete, the boys stopped going back for more and stood,
with the pink, shattered top of the mountain around them. Breath came
evenly by now , and sweat dried.
Ralph and Jack looked at each other while society paused about them.
The shameful knowledge grew in them and they did not know how to begin
confession.
Ralph spoke first, crimson in the face.
"W ill you?"
He cleared his throat and went on.
"W ill you light the fire?"
Now the absurd situation was open, Jack blushed too. He began to mutter
vaguely .
"Y ou rub two sticks. Y ou rub―"
He glanced at Ralph, who blurted out the last confession of
incompetence.
"Has anyone got any matches?"
