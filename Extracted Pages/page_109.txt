He thought for a moment, formulating the question.
"Who thinks there may be ghosts?"
For a long time there was silence and no apparent movement. Then Ralph

The conch was snatched from his hands and Piggy's voice shrilled.
"I didn't vote for no ghosts!"
He whirled round on the assembly .
"Remember that, all of you!"
They heard him stamp.

A shadow fronted him tempestuously .
"Y ou shut up, you fat slug!"
