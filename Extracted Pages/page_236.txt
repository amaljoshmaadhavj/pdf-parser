Silence above. He sounded silly  to himself. He lowered himself down the
rock.
"What are you going to do―?"
From the top of the towering rock came the incomprehensible reply .
"Roger sharpened a stick at both ends."
Roger sh arpened a stick at both ends. Ralph tried to attach a meaning to

What di d it mean? Someone besides himself was in trouble, for at least one
of the twins was catching it. Th en the voices passed away down the rock
