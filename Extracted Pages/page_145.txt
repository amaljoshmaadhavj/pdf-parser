"Why do you hate me?"
The boy s stirred uneasily , as th ough something indecent had been said.
The silence lengthened.
Ralph, still hot and hurt, turned away first.
"Come on."
He led the way and set himself  as by right to hack at the tangles. Jack
brought up the rear , displaced and brooding.
The pig- track w as a dark tunne l, for the sun was sliding quickly toward
the e dge of the world and in the forest shadows were never far to seek. The
track was broad and beaten and they ran along at a swift trot. Then the roof
of leave s broke up and they ha lted, breathing quickly , looking  at the few
stars that pricked round the head of the mountain.
"There you are."
The boys peered at each other doubtfully . Ralph made a decision.
"W e'll go straight across to the platform and climb tomorrow ."
They murmured agreement; but Jack was standing by his shoulder .
"If you're frightened of course―"
Ralph turned on him.
"Who went first on the castle rock?"
"I went too. And that was daylight."
"All right. Who wants to climb the mountain now?" Silence was the only
answer .
"Samneric? What about you?"
