The dan cing, chanting boys had worked themselves away till their sound
was nothing but a wordless rhythm.
"But s'pose they don't make sense? Not here, on this island? Supposing
things are watching us and waiting?"
Ralph shuddered violently and moved closer to Piggy , so that they
bumped frighteningly .
"Y ou stop talking like that! W e g ot enough trouble, Ralph, an' I've had as

"I ought to give up being chief. Hear 'em."
"Oh lord! Oh no!"
Piggy gripped Ralph's arm.
"If Jack was chief he'd have all hunting and no fire. W e'd be here till we
died."
His voice ran up to a squeak.
"Who's that sitting there?"
"Me. Simon."
"Fat lot of good we are," said Ralph. "Three blind mice. I'll give up."
"If you give up," said Piggy , in an appalled whisper , "what 'ud h appen to
me?"
"Nothing."
"He hate s me. I dunno why . If he could do what he wanted― you're all
right, he respects you. Besides―you'd hit him."
