"Except the hunters. W ell, the littluns are―"
He gesticulated, sought for a word.
"They're hopeless. The older ones aren't much better . D'you see ? All day
I've been  workin g with Simon. No one else. They're of f bathing, or eating,
or playing."
Simon poked his head out carefully .
"Y ou're chief. Y ou tell 'em of f."
Ralph lay flat and looked up at the palm trees and the sky .
"Meetings. Don 't we love meet ings? Every day . T wice a day . W e talk."
He got on one e lbow . "I bet if I blew the conch this minute, t hey'd come
running. Then we'd be, you know , very solemn, and someone would say we
ought to build a  jet, or a submarine, or a TV set. When the m eeting was
over they'd work for five minutes, then wander of f or go hunting."
Jack flushed.
"W e want meat."
"W ell, we haven't got any yet. A nd we want shelters. Besides, t he rest of
your hunters came back hours ago. They've been swimming."
"I went on," said Jack. "I let them go. I had to go on. I―"
He tried to convey the compulsion to track down and kill that was
swallowing him up.
"I went on. I thought, by myself―"
The madness came into his eyes again.
"I thought I might―kill."
"But you didn't."
