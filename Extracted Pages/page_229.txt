The slan ting sticks of sunlight were lost among the branches. At length
he came  to a cl earing in the fo rest where rock prevented vegetation from
growing. Now it was a pool of shadows and Ralph nearly flung himself
behind a  tree when he saw something standing in the center; but then he
saw that the white face was bone and that the pig's skull grin ned at him
from the top of a stick. He wal ked slowly into the middle of the clearing
and look ed steadily at the skull that gleamed as white as ever th e conch had
done and seemed to jeer at him  cynically . An inquisitive ant was busy in
one of the eye sockets but otherwise the thing was lifeless.
Or was it?
Little pr ickles of sensation ran up and down his back. He stood,  the skull
about on  a level with his face, and held up his hair with two hands. The
teeth gri nned, the empty sockets seemed to hold his gaze masterfully and
without ef fort.
What was it?
The sku ll regard ed Ralph like o ne who knows all the answers and won't
tell. A sick fear and rage swept him. Fiercely he hit out at the filthy thing in
front of him that bobbed like a toy and came back, still grinn ing into his
face, so that he lashed and cried out in loathing. Then he was  licking his
bruised knuckles and looking at the bare stick, while the skull lay in two
pieces, i ts grin now six feet acr oss. He wrenched the quivering stick from
the crack and held it as a spear between him and the white pieces. Then he
backed away , keeping his face to the skull that lay grinning at the sky .
When th e green  glow had gon e from the horizon and night was fully
accomplished, Ralph came again to the thicket in front of the Castle Rock.
Peeping through , he could see that the height was still occupied, and
whoever it was up there had a spear at the ready .
He k nelt among the shadows a nd felt his isolation bitterly . They were
savages it was true; but they were human, and the ambushing fears of the
deep night were coming on.
