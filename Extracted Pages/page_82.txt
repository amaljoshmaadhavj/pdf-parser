Jack, his face smeared with clays, reached the top first and hailed Ralph
excitedly , with lifted spear .
"Look! W e've killed a pig―we stole up on them―we got in a circle―"
V oices broke in from the hunters.
"W e got in a circle―"
"W e crept up―"
"The pig squealed―"
The twins stood with the pig s winging between them, dropp ing black
gouts on the roc k. They seemed to share one wide, ecstatic grin. Jack had
too m any things to tell Ralph at once. Instead, he danced a step or two, then
remembered his  dignity and stood still, grinning. He noticed blood on his
hands and grimaced distastefull y , looked for something on wh ich to clean
them, then wiped them on his shorts and laughed.
Ralph spoke.
"Y ou let the fire go out."
Jack che cked, v aguely irritated by this irrelevance but too happ y to let it
worry him.
"W e can  light the fire again. Y ou should have been with us, R alph. W e
had a smashing time. The twins got knocked over―"
"W e hit the pig―"
"―I fell on top―"
"I cu t the pig's throat," said Jack, proudly , and yet twitched as h e said it.
"Can I borrow yours, Ralph, to make a nick in the hilt?"
The boys chattered and danced. The twins continued to grin.
