"Y ou're talking too much," said Jack Merridew . "Shut up, Fatty ."
Laughter arose.
"He's not Fatty ," cried Ralph, "his real name's Piggy!"
"Piggy!"
"Piggy!"
"Oh, Piggy!"
A storm  of laughter arose and even the tiniest child joined in. For the
moment the boys were a closed circuit of sympathy with Piggy outside: he
went very pink, bowed his head and cleaned his glasses again.
Finally the laughter died away and the naming continued. There was
Maurice, next in size among the  choir boys to Jack, but broad a nd grinning
all the time. There was a slight, furtive boy whom no one knew , who kept to
himself with an inner intensity of avoidance and secrecy . He muttered that
his n ame was R oger and was si lent again. Bill, Robert, Harold, Henry; the
choir bo y who had fainted sat up against a palm trunk, smiled  pallidly at
Ralph and said that his name was Simon.
Jack spoke.
"W e've got to decide about being rescued."
There was a buzz. One of the s mall boys, Henry , said that he wanted to
go home.
"Shut up ," said Ralph absently .  He lifted the conch. "Seems to me we
ought to have a chief to decide things."
"A chief! A chief!"
"I o ught to be chief," said Jack with simple arrogance, "bec ause I'm
chapter chorister and head boy . I can sing C sharp."
