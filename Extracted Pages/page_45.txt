"But I tell you there isn't a beast!"
The assembly was silent.
Ralph lifted the conch again and his good humor came back as he
thought of what he had to say next.
"Now w e come  to the most important thing. I've been thinkin g. I was
thinking while we were climbing the mountain." He flashed a conspiratorial
grin at the other  two. "And on the beach just now . This is wha t I thought.
W e want to have fun. And we want to be rescued."
The passionate noise of agreement from the assembly hit him like a wave
and he lost his thread. He thought again.
"W e want to be rescued; and of course we shall be rescued."
V oices babbled.  The simple statement, unbacked by any proof but the
weight of Ralph's new authorit y , brought light and happiness. He had to
wave the conch before he could make them hear him.
"My fath er's in the Navy . He sa id there aren't any unknown isl ands left.
He says the Queen has a big room full of maps and all the islands in the
world are drawn there. So the Queen's got a picture of this island."
Again came the sounds of cheerfulness and better heart.
"And sooner or later a ship wi ll put in here. It might even be Daddy's
ship. So you see, sooner or later , we shall be rescued."
He p aused, with the point made . The assembly was lifted toward safety
by h is words. Th ey liked and now respected him. Spontaneously  they began
to clap and presently the platform was loud with applause. Ralph flushed,
looking sideway s at Piggy's ope n admiration, and then the other  way at Jack
who was smirking and showing that he too knew how to clap.
Ralph waved the conch.
"Shut up! W ait! Listen!"
