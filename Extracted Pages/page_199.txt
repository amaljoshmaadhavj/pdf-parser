"The rest of you can go to sleep as soon as the sun sets. But us three,
Maurice, Roger  and me, we've  got work to do. W e'll leave just before
sunset―"
Maurice put up his hand.
"But what happens if we meet―"
The chief waved his objection aside.
"W e'll keep along by the sands. Then if he comes we'll do our , our dance
again."
"Only the three of us?"
Again the murmur swelled and died away .
Piggy handed Ralph his glasses and waited to receive back his sight. The
wood w as damp ; and this was the third time they had lighted it. Ralph stood
back, speaking to himself.
"W e don't want another night without fire."
He look ed round guiltily at the three boys standing by . This was the first
time he had admitted the doubl e function of the fire. Certainly one was to
send up a beckoning column of smoke; but the other was to be a  hearth now
and a comfort u ntil they slept. E ric breathed on the wood till it glowed and
sent out  a little flame. A billow of white and yellow smoke reeked up.
Piggy took back his glasses and looked at the smoke with pleasure.
"If only we could make a radio!"
"Or a plane―"
"―or a boat."
Ralph dredged in his fading knowledge of the world.
"W e might get taken prisoner by the Reds."
