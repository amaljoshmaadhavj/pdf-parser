"Where's Jack?"
The gro up of boys stirred and c onsulted. A painted face spoke with the
voice of Robert.
"He's hunting. And he said we weren't to let you in."
"I've come to see about the fire," said Ralph, "and about Piggy's specs."
The gro up in front of him shifted and laughter shivered outwa rds from
among them, light, excited laughter that went echoing among the tall rocks.
A voice spoke from behind Ralph.
"What do you want?"
The twin s made  a bolt past Ralph and got between him and the entry . He
turned q uickly . Jack, identifiable  by personality and red hair , was advancing
from the forest. A hunter crouch ed on either side. All three were masked in
black an d green.  Behind them o n the grass the headless and paunched body
of a sow lay where they had dropped it.
Piggy wailed.
"Ralph! Don't leave me!"
W ith lud icrous care he embraced the rock, pressing himself to it above
the sucking sea. The sniggering of the savages became a loud derisive jeer .
Jack shouted above the noise.
"Y ou go away , Ralph. Y ou keep to your end. This is my end and my tribe.
Y ou leave me alone."
The jeering died away .
"Y ou pinched Piggy's specs," s aid Ralph, breathlessly . "Y ou've got to
give them back."
