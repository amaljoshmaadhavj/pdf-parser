Ralph looked down the other way where there was no reef.
"Steeper ," said Jack.
Ralph made a cupping gesture.
"That bit of forest down there... the mountain holds it up."
Every p oint of the mountain held up trees―flowers and trees.  Now the
forest st irred, roared, flailed. The nearer acres of rock flowers fluttered and
for half a minute the breeze blew cool on their faces.
Ralph spread his arms.
"All ours."
They laughed and tumbled and shouted on the mountain.
"I'm hungry ."
When Simon mentioned his hunger the others became aware of theirs.
"Come on," said Ralph. "W e've found out what we wanted to know ."
They scrambled  down a rock slope, dropped among flowers a nd made
their wa y under the trees. Here t hey paused and examined the b ushes round
them curiously .
Simon spoke first.
"Like candles. Candle bushes. Candle buds."
The bushes were dark ever gree n and aromatic and the many buds were
waxen g reen an d folded up against the light. Jack slashed at one with his
knife and the scent spilled over them.
"Candle buds."
"Y ou couldn't light them," said Ralph. "They just look like candles."
