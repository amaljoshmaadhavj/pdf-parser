The bus hes crashed ahead of th em. Boys flung themselves wildly from
the pig track an d scrabbled in the creepers, screaming. Ralph saw Jack
nudged aside and fall. Then there was a creature bounding along the pig
track to ward him, with tusks g leaming and an intimidating grunt. Ralph
found he was ab le to measure the distance coldly and take aim. W ith the
boar only five ya rds away , he flung the foolish wooden stick that he carried,
saw it hit the great snout and hang there for a moment. The boar's note
changed to a squeal and it swerved aside into the covert. The pig-run filled
with shouting boys again, Jack came running back, and poked about in the
under growth.
"Through here―"
"But he'd do us!"
"Through here, I said―"
The boar was fl oundering away from them. They found another pig-run
parallel to the first and Jack raced away . Ralph was full of fright and
apprehension and pride.
"I hit him! The spear stuck in―"
Now the y came , unexpectedly , to an open space by the sea. Jack cast
about on the bare rock and looked anxious.
"He's gone."
"I hit him," said Ralph again, "and the spear stuck in a bit."
He felt the need of witnesses.
"Didn't you see me?"
Maurice nodded.
"I saw you. Right bang on his snout―Wheee!"
Ralph talked on, excitedly .
