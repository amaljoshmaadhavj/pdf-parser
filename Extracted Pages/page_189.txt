CHAPTER TEN
     
The Shell and the Glasses
     
Piggy eyed the advancing figur e carefully . Nowadays he sometimes found
that he saw more clearly if he re moved his glasses and shifted the one lens
to the other eye; but even through the good eye, after what had  happened,
Ralph remained unmistakably Ralph. He came now out of the coconut trees,
limping, dirty , with dead leaves hanging from his shock of yellow hair . One
eye was a slit in his puf fy cheek and a great scab had formed on his right
knee. He paused for a moment and peered at the figure on the platform.
"Piggy? Are you the only one left?"
"There's some littluns."
"They don't count. No biguns?"
"Oh―Samneric. They're collecting wood."
"Nobody else?"
"Not that I know of."
Ralph climbed on to the platfo rm carefully . The coarse grass was still
worn aw ay whe re the assembly used to sit; the fragile white conch still
gleamed by the polished seat. Ralph sat down in the grass facin g the chief's
seat and  the conch. Piggy knelt at his left, and for a long minute there was
silence.
At last Ralph cleared his throat and whispered something.
Piggy whispered back.
