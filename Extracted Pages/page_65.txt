The two boys trotted down the beach, and, turning at the water's edge,
looked b ack at the pink mountain. The trickle of smoke sketched a chalky
line up the sol id blue of the sky , wavered high up and fa ded. Ralph
frowned.
"I wonder how far of f you could see that."
"Miles."
"W e don't make enough smoke."
The bot tom part of the trickl e, as though conscious of their gaze,
thickened to a creamy blur which crept up the feeble column.
"They've put on green branches," muttered Ralph. "I wonder!" He
screwed up his eyes and swung round to search the horizon.
"Got it!"
Jack shouted so loudly that Ralph jumped.
"What? Where? Is it a ship?"
But Jack was pointing to the high declivities that led down from the
mountain to the flatter part of the island.
"Of course! They'll lie up there―they must, when the sun's too hot―"
Ralph gazed bewildered at his rapt face.
"―they get up high. High up a nd in the shade, resting during the heat,
like cows at home―"
"I thought you saw a ship!"
