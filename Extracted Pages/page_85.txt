Piggy began again.
"Y ou did n't ough t to have let that fire out. Y ou said you'd keep t he smoke
going―"
This from Piggy , and the wails of agreement from some of the hunters,
drove Ja ck to violence. The bolt ing look came into his blue eyes. He took a
step, and able at last to hit someone, stuck his fist into Piggy's stomach.
Piggy sat down with a grunt. Jack stood over him. His voice was vicious
with humiliation.
"Y ou would, would you? Fatty!"
Ralph made a step forward an d Jack smacked Piggy's head. Piggy's
glasses flew of f and tinkled on the rocks. Piggy cried out in terror:
"My specs!"
He went crouching and feeling over the rocks but Simon, who got there
first, fou nd them for him. Passions beat about Simon on the m ountain-top
with awful wings.
"One side's broken."
Piggy grabbed and put on the glasses. He looked malevolently at Jack.
"I got to have them specs. Now I only got one eye. Jus' you wait―"
Jack ma de a move toward Piggy  who scrambled away till a great rock lay
between them. He thrust his he ad over the top and glared at J ack through
his one flashing glass.
"Now I only got one eye. Just you wait―"
Jack mimicked the whine and scramble.
"Jus' you wait―yah!"
