"How could I," cried Piggy indi gnantly , "all by myself? They waited for
two minutes, then they fell in t he sea; they went into the forest; they just
scattered everywhere. How was I to know which was which?"
Ralph licked pale lips.
"Then you don't know how many of us there ought to be?"
"How co uld I with them little 'un s running round like insects? T hen when
you three came back, as soon as you said make a fire, they all ran away , and
I never had a chance―"
"That's enough!" said Ralph sharply , and snatched back the conch. "If
you didn't you didn't."
"―then you come up here an' pinch my specs―"
Jack turned on him.
"Y ou shut up!"
"―and t hem litt le 'uns was wand ering about down there where t he fire is.
How d'you know they aren't still there?"
Piggy st ood up and pointed to the smoke and flames. A mur mur rose
among the boys and died away . Something strange was happening to Piggy ,
for he was gasping for breath.
"That lit tle 'un― " gasped Piggy―"him with the mark on his face, I don't
see him. Where is he now?"
The crowd was as silent as death.
"Him that talked about the snakes. He was down there―"
A tree exploded in the fire like a bomb. T all swathes of creeper s rose for
a m oment into view , agonized , and went down again. The little boys
screamed at them.
