"No. A shell."
Suddenly Piggy was a-bubble with decorous excitement.
"S'right. It's a sh ell! I seen one like that before. On someone's b ack wall.
A conch he called it. He used to blow it and then his mum would come. It's
ever so valuable―"
Near to Ralph's elbow a palm sa pling leaned out over the lagoon . Indeed,
the w eight was already pulling a  lump from the poor soil and so on it would
fall. He tore out the stem and began to poke about in the wate r , while the
brilliant fish flicked away on this side and that. Piggy leaned dangerously .
"Careful! Y ou'll break it―"
"Shut up."
Ralph spoke absently . The shell was interesting and pretty and a worthy
plaything; but the vivid phantoms of his day-dream still interposed between
him and Piggy , who in this context was an irrelevance. The palm sapling,
bending, pushed  the shell acro ss the weeds. Ralph used one  hand as a
fulcrum and pressed down with  the other till the shell rose, dr ipping, and
Piggy could make a grab.
Now the  shell was no longer a thing seen but not to be touched, Ralph
too became excited. Piggy babbled:
"―a con ch; ever so expensive. I  bet if you wanted to buy one, you'd have
to pay pounds and pounds and pounds―he had it on his garde n wall, and
my auntie―"
Ralph took the s hell from Piggy and a little water ran down his arm. In
color the shell was deep cream, touched here and there with fading pink.
Between the point, worn away into a little hole, and the pink  lips of the
mouth, l ay eigh teen inches of s hell with a slight spiral twist and covered
with a delicate, embossed pattern. Ralph shook sand out of the deep tube.
