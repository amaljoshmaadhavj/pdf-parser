understood them . One had to sit, attracting all eyes to the conch, and drop
words like heavy round stones  among the little groups that crouched or
squatted. He was searching his mind for simple words so that even the
littluns would understand what the assembly was about. Later perhaps,
practiced debaters―Jack, Maurice, Piggy―would use their whole art to
twist the meeting: but now at th e beginning the subject of the debate must
be laid out clearly .
"W e need an ass embly . Not for fun. Not for laughing and falling of f the
log"―the group of littluns on the twister giggled and look ed at each
other―"not for making jokes, o r for"―he lifted the conch in an ef fort to
find the compelling word―"for  cleverness. Not for these things. But to put
things straight."
He paused for a moment.
"I've bee n alone . By myself I went, thinking what's what. I know what
we need. An assembly to put things straight. And first of all, I'm speaking."
He paus ed for a moment and automatically pushed back his hair . Piggy
tiptoed to the triangle, his inef fectual protest made, and joined the others.
Ralph went on.
"W e have lots of assemblies. Everybody enjoys speaking a nd being
together . W e decide things. But they don't get done. W e were going to have
water br ought fr om the stream and left in those coconut shells under fresh
leaves. S o it was, for a few day s. Now there's no water . The shells are dry .
People drink from the river ."
There was a murmur of assent.
"Not tha t there's  anything wrong with drinking from the river . I mean I'd
sooner h ave wat er from that plac e― you know , the pool where the waterfall
is―than out of an old coconut shell. Only we said we'd have the water
brought. And now not. There were only two full shells there this afternoon."
He licked his lips.
