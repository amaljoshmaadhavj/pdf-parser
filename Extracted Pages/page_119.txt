yards away from them came the plopping noise of fabric blown open.
Neither of the b oys screamed but the grip of their arms tight ened and
their mouths grew peaked. For p erhaps ten seconds they crouched like that
while th e flailin g fire sent smok e and sparks and waves of inconstant light
over the top of the mountain.
Then as though they had but one terrified mind between th em they
scrambled away over the rocks and fled.
Ralph w as dreaming. He had fallen asleep after what seemed  hours of
tossing and turning noisily among the dry leaves. Even the sounds of
nightmare from the other shelter s no longer reached him, for he was back to
where he came from, feeding the ponies with sugar over the garden wall.
Then someone was shaking his arm, telling him that it was time for tea.
"Ralph! W ake up!"
The leaves were roaring like the sea.
"Ralph, wake up!"
"What's the matter?"
"W e saw―"
"―the beast―"
"―plain!"
"Who are you? The twins?"
"W e saw the beast―"
"Quiet. Piggy!"
The leaves were roaring still. Piggy bumped into him and a twin grabbed
him as he made for the oblong of paling stars.
