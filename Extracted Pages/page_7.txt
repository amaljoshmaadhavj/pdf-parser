"Where's the man with the megaphone?"
The fair boy shook his head.
"This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the
sea. Perhaps there aren't any grownups anywhere."
The fat boy looked startled.
"There w as that pilot. But he wa sn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in
front."
The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.
"All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got
out. They must have, mustn't they?"
The fair  boy began to pick his way as casually as possible to ward the
water . H e tried to be of fhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat
boy hurried after him.
"Aren't there any grownups at all?"
"I don't think so."
The fair boy s aid this solemnly; but then the delight of a  realized
ambition overcame him. In the m iddle of the scar he stood on h is head and
grinned at the reversed fat boy .
"No grownups!"
The fat boy thought for a moment.
"That pilot."
The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth.
"He must have flown of f after he dropped us. He couldn't land here. Not
in a place with wheels."
