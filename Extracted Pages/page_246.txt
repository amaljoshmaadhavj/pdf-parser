A face.
The sav age peer ed into the obsc urity beneath the thicket. Y ou could tell
that he saw light on this side and on that, but not in the middl e―there. In
the midd le was a blob of dark an d the savage wrinkled up his face, trying to
decipher the darkness.
The sec onds lengthened. Ralph was looking straight into the savage's
eyes.
Don't scream.
Y ou'll get back.
Now he's seen you. He's making sure. A stick sharpened.
Ralph sc reamed, a scream of fright and anger and desperation.  His legs
straightened, the screams became continuous and foaming. He shot
forward, burst the thicket, was i n the open, screaming, snarling, bloody . He
swung th e stake  and the savage tumbled over; but there were others coming
toward him, crying out. He swerved as a spear flew past and then was
silent, running. All at once th e lights flickering ahead of h im mer ged
together , the roar of the forest rose to thunder and a tall bush directly in his
path bur st into a great fan-shaped flame. He swung to the rig ht, running
desperately fast, with the heat beating on his left side and the fire racing
forward like a ti de. The ululation rose behind him and spread along, a series
of short sharp cries, the sighting  call. A brown figure showed up at his right
and fell away . T hey were all running, all crying out madly . He could hear
them cra shing in the under growth and on the left was the hot, bright thunder
of the fire. He f or got his wounds, his hunger and thirst, and b ecame fear;
hopeless fear on flying feet, rushing through the forest towa rd the open
beach. S pots jumped before his eyes and turned into red circles that
expanded quick ly till they passed out of sight. Below him someone's legs
were getting tired and the despe rate ululation advanced like a jagged fringe
of menace and was almost overhead.
He stum bled ov er a root and the cry that pursued him rose even higher .
He saw a shelter burst into flames and the fire flapped at his right shoulder
