"W e was attacked!"
"He'll be back all right."
The fat boy shook his head.
"When w e was coming down I looked through one of them w indows. I
saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it."
He looked up and down the scar .
"And this is what the cabin done."
The fair boy reached out and touched the jagged end of a trunk. For a
moment he looked interested.
"What happened to it?" he asked. "Where's it got to now?"
"That st orm dra gged it out to sea. It wasn't half dangerous with all them
tree trunks falling. There must have been some kids still in it."
He hesitated for a moment, then spoke again.
"What's your name?"
"Ralph."
The fat boy waited to be asked his name in turn but this prof fer of
acquaintance wa s not made; the fair boy called Ralph smiled vaguely , stood
up, and began to make his way  once more toward the lagoon. The fat boy
hung steadily at his shoulder .
"I expec t there's a lot more of u s scattered about. Y ou haven't seen any
others, have you?"
Ralph sh ook his  head and incre ased his speed. Then he trippe d over a
branch and came down with a crash.
The fat boy stood by him, breathing hard.
