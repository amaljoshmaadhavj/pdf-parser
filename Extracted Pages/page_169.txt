"I know that."
Simon discovere d that he had spoken aloud. He opened his eyes quickly
and there was th e head grinning amusedly in the strange daylig ht, ignoring
the f lies, the spilled guts, even ignoring the indignity of being spiked on a
stick.
He looked away , licking his dry lips.
A gift for the beast. Might no t the beast come for it? The head, he
thought, appeare d to agree with  him. Run away , said the head silently , go
back to the othe rs. It was a joke really―why should you bother? Y ou were
just wro ng, that's all. A little headache, something you ate, p erhaps. Go
back, child, said the head silently .
Simon looked up, feeling the weight of his wet hair , and gazed at the sky .
Up t here, for once, were cloud s, great bulging towers that spr outed away
over the island, grey and cream and copper -colored. The clouds were sitting
on the land; th ey squeezed, produced moment by moment this close,
tormenting heat. Even the butterflies deserted the open space where the
obscene thing grinned and dripped. Simon lowered his head, carefully
keeping his eyes shut, then sheltered them with his hand. There were no
shadows under the trees but everywhere a pearly stillness, so that what was
real seem ed illu sive and without definition. The pile of guts was a black
blob of flies tha t buzzed like a saw . After a while these flies fo und Simon.
Gor ged, they alighted by his runnels of sweat and drank. They ti ckled under
his nostrils and played leapfr og on his thighs. They were black and
iridescent green and without number; and in front of Simon, the Lord of the
Flies hun g on his stick and grinned. At last Simon gave up and looked back;
saw the white te eth and dim eye s, the blood―and his gaze was held by that
ancient, inescap able recognition. In Simon's right temple, a pulse began to
beat on the brain.
Ralph and Piggy lay in the sand, gazing at the fire and idly  flicking
pebbles into its smokeless heart.
"That branch is gone."
