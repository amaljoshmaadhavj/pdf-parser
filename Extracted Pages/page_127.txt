Behind Ralph the tall grass had filled with silent hunters. Ralph looked at
Jack.
"Y ou're a hunter ."
Jack went red.
"I know . All right."
Something deep in Ralph spoke for him.
"I'm chief. I'll go. Don't ar gue."
He turned to the others.
"Y ou. Hide here. W ait for me."
He foun d his voice tended either  to disappear or to come out too  loud. He
looked at Jack.
"Do you―think?"
Jack muttered.
"I've been all over . It must be here."
"I see."
      Simon mumbled confusedly: "I don't believe in the beast."
Ralph answered him politely , as if agreeing about the weather .
"No. I suppose not."
His mouth was tight and pale. He put back his hair very slowly .
"W ell. So long."
