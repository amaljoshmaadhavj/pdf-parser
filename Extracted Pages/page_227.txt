CHAPTER TWEL VE
     
Cry of the Hunters
     
Ralph lay in a covert, wondering about his wounds. The bruised flesh was
inches in  diameter over his right ribs, with a swollen and bloody  scar where
the spear had hit him. His hair was full of dirt and tapped like the tendrils of

dribbled. He wiped his nose and mouth with the back of his hand and for
the first time sin ce the morning felt hungry . The tribe must be s itting round
