"But―the fire."
He f rowned at the black and white mess in which lay the unburn t ends of
branches. He tried to formulate.
"I'm scared."
He saw Piggy look up; and blundered on.
"Not of the be ast. I mean I'm scared of that too. But nob ody else
understands abo ut the fire. If someone threw you a rope when you were
drowning. If a doctor said tak e this because if you don't take it you'll
die―you would, wouldn't you? I mean?"
"'Course I would."
"Can't th ey see? Can't they und erstand? W ithout the smoke signal we'll
die here? Look at that!"
A wave of heat ed air trembled above the ashes but without a trace of
smoke.
"W e can 't keep one fire going. A nd they don't care. And what's  more―"
He looked intensely into Piggy's streaming face.
"What's more, I  don't sometimes. Supposing I got like the others―not
caring. What 'ud become of us?"
Piggy took of f his glasses, deeply troubled.
"I dunno , Ralph . W e just got to go on, that's all. That's what grownups
would do."
Ralph, having begun the business of unburdening himself, continued.
"Piggy , what's wrong?"
Piggy looked at him in astonishment.
