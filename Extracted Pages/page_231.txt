them and was momentarily eclipsed by some movement.
Ralph ed ged forward, feeling his way over the uneven surface as though
he were blind. T here were miles of vague water at his right and the restless
ocean lay under his left hand, as awful as the shaft of a pit. Every minute
the water breathed round the death rock and flowered into a field of
whiteness. Ralph  crawled until he found the ledge of the entry i n his grasp.
The loo kouts were immediately above him and he could see the end of a
spear projecting over the rock.
He called very gently .
"Samneric―"
There w as no reply . T o carry he  must speak louder; and this would rouse
those str iped an d inimical creatures from their feasting by the fire. He set
his teeth and started to climb, finding the holds by touch. The stick that had
supported a skull hampered him but he would not be parted from his only
weapon. He was nearly level with the twins before he spoke again.
"Samneric―"
He h eard a cry and a flurry fro m the rock. The twins had grabbed each
other and were gibbering.
"It's me. Ralph."
T errified that they would run and give the alarm, he hauled h imself up
until his head an d shoulders stuck over the top. Far below his armpit he saw
the luminous flowering round the rock.
"It's only me. Ralph."
At length they bent forward and peered in his face.
"W e thought it was―"
"―we didn't know what it was―"
