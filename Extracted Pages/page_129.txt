half-cave that held nothing more  terrible than a clutch of rotten eggs, and at
last sat down, looking round him  and tapping the rock with the butt of his
spear .
Jack was excited.
"What a place for a fort!"
A column of spray wetted them.
"No fresh water ."
"What's that then?"
There w as indeed a long green smudge half-way up the rock. They
climbed up and tasted the trickle of water .
"Y ou could keep a coconut shell there, filling all the time."
"Not me. This is a rotten place."
Side by side the y scaled the last height to where the diminishing  pile was
crowned by the last broken rock . Jack struck the near one with h is fist and it
grated slightly .
"Do you remember―?"

talked quickly .
"Shove a palm trunk under that and if an enemy came― look!"

ground, then the grass dotted with heads, and behind that the forest.
"One heave," cried Jack, exulting, "and―wheee―!"
