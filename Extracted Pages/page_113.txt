"Y ou were having a nice fight with him just now ."
"I had the conch," said Piggy simply . "I had a right to speak."
Simon stirred in the dark.
"Go on being chief."
"Y ou shut up, young Simon! Why couldn't you say there wasn't a beast?"
"I'm sca red of him," said Piggy , "and that's why I know him.  If you're
scared of someone you hate him but you can't stop thinking about him. Y ou
kid yourself he's all right really , an' then when you see him again; it's like
asthma an' you can't breathe. I tell you what. He hates you too, Ralph―"
"Me? Why me?"
"I dunno. Y ou got him over the fire; an' you're chief an' he isn't."
"But he's, he's, Jack Merridew!"
"I b een in bed so much I done  some thinking. I know about people. I
know about me. And him. He can't hurt you: but if you stand out of the way
he'd hurt the next thing. And that's me."
"Piggy's right, Ralph. There's you and Jack. Go on being chief."
"W e're all drifting and things are going rotten. At home there was always
a grownup. Please, sir , please, miss; and then you got an answer . How I
wish!"
"I wish my auntie was here."
"I wish my father ... Oh, what's the use?"
"Keep the fire going."
The dance was over and the hunters were going back to the shelters.
