"Perhaps," said the chief. A theological speculation presented itself.
"W e'd better keep on the right side of him, anyhow . Y ou can't tell what he
might do."
The trib e considered this; and th en were shaken, as if by a flow  of wind.
The chief saw the ef fect of his words and stood abruptly .
"But tomorrow we'll hunt and when we've got meat we'll have a feast―"
Bill put up his hand.
"Chief."
"Y es?"

hand.
"W e sha ll take fire from the oth ers. Listen. T omorrow we'll hunt and get
meat. T onight I'll go along with two hunters―who'll come?"
Maurice and Roger put up their hands.
"Maurice―"

"Where was their fire?"
"Back at the old place by the fire rock."
The chief nodded.
