Laughing, Ralph looked for confirmation round the ring of faces. The
older bo ys agreed; but here and  there among the little ones was the doubt
that required more than rational assurance.
"He must have had a nightm are. Stumbling about among all those
creepers."
More grave nodding; they knew  about nightmares. "He says he saw the
beastie, the snake-thing, and will it come back tonight?"
"But there isn't a beastie!"
"He say s in the morning it turned into them things like ropes in  the trees
and hung in the branches. He says will it come back tonight?"
"But there isn't a beastie!"
There w as no laughter at all now  and more grave watching. Ralp h pushed
both han ds through his hair and looked at the little boy in mixed  amusement
and exasperation.
Jack seized the conch.
"Ralph's right of course. There  isn't a snake-thing. But if there was a
snake w e'd hunt it and kill it. W e're going to hunt pigs to g et meat for
everybody . And we'll look for the snake too―"
"But there isn't a snake!"
"W e'll make sure when we go hunting."
Ralph w as anno yed and, for the moment, defeated. He felt hims elf facing
something ungr aspable. The eyes that looked so intently at him were
without humor .
"But there isn't a beast!"
Something he had not known wa s there rose in him and compelled him to
make the point, loudly and again.
