Piggy an d the parody were so funny that the hunters began to laugh. Jack
felt encouraged.  He went on scrambling and the laughter rose to a gale of
hysteria. Unwillingly Ralph felt  his lips twitch; he was angry w ith himself
for giving way .
He muttered.
"That was a dirty trick."
Jack bro ke out of his gyration an d stood facing Ralph. His words came in
a shout.
"All right, all right!"
He looked at Piggy , at the hunters, at Ralph.
"I'm sorry . About the fire, I mean. There. I―"
He drew himself up.
"―I apologize."
The buz z from the hunters was one of admiration at this h andsome
behavior . Clearl y they were of the opinion that Jack had done the decent
thing, had put himself in the r ight by his generous apology and Ralph,
obscurely , in the wrong. They waited for an appropriately decent answer .
Y et Ralp h's thro at refused to p ass one. He resented, as an addition to
Jack's m isbehavior , this verbal trick. The fire was dead, the ship was gone.
Could they not see? Anger instead of decency passed his throat.
"That was a dirty trick."
They we re silent on the mountain-top while the opaque look appeared in
Jack's eyes and passed away .
Ralph's final word was an ingracious mutter .
"All right. Light the fire."
