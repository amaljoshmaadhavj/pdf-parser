"Me."
"I will."
"I'll blow the conch," said Ralph breathlessly , "and call an assembly ."
"W e shan't hear it."
Piggy touched Ralph's wrist.
"Come away . There's going to be trouble. And we've had our meat."
There was a bl ink of bright l ight beyond the forest and the  thunder
exploded again so that a littlun started to whine. Big drops of rain fell
among them making individual sounds when they struck.
"Going to be a storm," said Ralph, "and you'll have rain like when we
dropped here. Who's clever now? Where are your shelters? What are you
going to do about that?"
The hun ters wer e looking uneasily at the sky , flinching from the stroke of
the drops. A w ave of restlessness set the boys swaying a nd moving
aimlessly . The flickering light be came brighter and the blows of  the thunder
were only just bearable. The littluns began to run about, screaming.
Jack leapt on to the sand.
"Do our dance! Come on! Dance!"
He ran stumbling through the thick sand to the open space of rock
beyond the fire. Between the flashes of lightning the air was dark and
terrible; and the boys followed  him, clamorously . Roger became the pig,
grunting and char ging at Jack, who side-stepped. The hunters took their
spears, the cooks took spits, and the rest clubs of firewood. A circling
movement devel oped and a chan t. While Roger mimed the terro r of the pig,
the littluns ran and jumped on the outside of the circle. Piggy  and Ralph,
under the threat of the sky , found themselves eager to take a p lace in this
demented but partly secure society . They were glad to touch the brown
backs of the fence that hemmed in the terror and made it governable.
