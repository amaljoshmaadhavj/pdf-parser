then went swinging and flaring along the whole row of them. Beneath the
capering boys a quarter of a mi le square of forest was savage with smoke
and flame. The separate noises  of the fire mer ged into a dru m-roll that
seemed to shake the mountain.
"Y ou got your small fire all right."
Startled, Ralph realized that the boys were falling still and silent, feeling
the beginnings of awe at the power set free below them. The knowledge and
the awe made him savage.
"Oh, shut up!"
"I got the conch," said Piggy , in a hurt voice. "I got a right to speak."
They looked at him with eyes t hat lacked interest in what they saw , and
cocked e ars at the drum-roll of the fire. Piggy glanced nervously into hell
and cradled the conch.
"W e got to let that burn out now . And that was our firewood."
He licked his lips.
"There ain't nothing we can do. W e ought to be more car eful. I'm
scared―"
Jack dragged his eyes away from the fire.
"Y ou're always scared. Y ah―Fatty!"
"I got the conc h," said Piggy bleakly . He turned to Ralph. "I got the
conch, ain't I Ralph?"
Unwillingly Ralph turned away from the splendid, awful sight.
"What's that?"
"The conch. I got a right to speak."
