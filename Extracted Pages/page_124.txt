"Conch! Conch! " shouted Jack. "W e don't need the conch any m ore. W e
know w ho ough t to say things. What good did Simon do speaking, or Bill,
or W alter? It's time some peopl e knew they've got to keep quiet and leave
deciding things to the rest of us."
Ralph could no longer ignore his speech. The blood was hot in his
cheeks.
"Y ou haven't got the conch," he said. "Sit down."
Jack's fa ce went  so white that the freckles showed as clear , brown flecks.
He licked his lips and remained standing.
"This is a hunter's job."
The res t of the boys watched intently . Piggy , finding himself
uncomfortably e mbroiled, slid the conch to Ralph's knees and sat down.
The silence grew oppressive and Piggy held his breath.
"This is more than a hunter's job," said Ralph at last, "because you can't
track the beast. And don't you want to be rescued?"
He turned to the assembly .
"Don't you all want to be rescued?"
He looked back at Jack.
"I said before, the fire is the main thing. Now the fire must be out―"
The old exasperation saved him and gave him the ener gy to attack.
"Hasn't anyone got any sense? W e've got to relight that fire. Y ou never
thought of that, Jack, did you? Or don't any of you want to be rescued?"
Y es, they wanted to be rescued, there was no doubt about that; and with a
violent swing to Ralph's side, th e crisis passed. Piggy let out his breath with
a gasp, reached for it again an d failed. He lay against a log, his mouth
gaping, blue shadows creeping round his lips. Nobody minded him.
