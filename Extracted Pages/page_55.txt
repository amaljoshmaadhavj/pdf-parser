The twins giggled together .
"W e wanted smoke―"
"Now look―!"
A p all stretched for miles away from the island. All the boy s except
Piggy started to giggle; presently they were shrieking with laughter .
Piggy lost his temper .
"I go t the conch! Just you listen! The first thing we ought to have made
was shelters down there by the beach. It wasn't half cold down there in the
night. B ut the first time Ralph says 'fire' you goes howling and  screaming
up this here mountain. Like a pack of kids!"
By now they were listening to the tirade.
"How ca n you expect to be resc ued if you don't put first things first and
act proper?"
He t ook of f his glasses and made as if to put down the conch; but the
sudden motion toward it of mo st of the older boys changed his mind. He
tucked the shell under his arm, and crouched back on a rock.
"Then when you get here you b uild a bonfire that isn't no use. Now you
been an d set the whole island on fire. W on't we look funny i f the whole
island burns up? Cooked fruit, that's what we'll have to eat, and roast pork.
And tha t's nothing to laugh at! Y ou said Ralph was chief and yo u don't give
him time to think. Then when he says something you rush of f, like, like―"
He paused for breath, and the fire growled at them.
"And that's not all. Them kids. The little 'uns. Who took any notice of
'em? Who knows how many we got?"
Ralph took a sudden step forward.
"I told you to. I told you to get a list of names!"
