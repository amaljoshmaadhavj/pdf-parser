CHAPTER TWO
     
Fir e on the Mountain
     
By t he time Ral ph finished blowing the conch the platform w as crowded.
There w ere dif ferences between this meeting and the one held in the
morning. The afternoon sun sla nted in from the other side of t he platform
and mos t of the children, feeling  too late the smart of sunburn, h ad put their
clothes on. The choir , less of a group, had discarded their cloaks.
Ralph sat on a fallen trunk, his left side to the sun. On his right were most
of the choir; on  his left the lar ger boys who had not known  each other
before the evacuation; before him small children squatted in the grass.
Silence now . Ralph lifted the cream and pink shell to his knees and a
sudden b reeze scattered light over the platform. He was uncertain whether
to stand up or remain sitting. He looked sideways to his left, toward the
bathing pool. Piggy was sitting near but giving no help.
Ralph cleared his throat.
"W ell then."
All at once he found he could talk fluently and explain what he had to
say . He passed a hand through his fair hair and spoke.
"W e're on an isl and. W e've been on the mountain top and seen water all
round. W e saw no houses, no smoke, no footprints, no boats, no people.
W e're on an uninhabited island with no other people on it."
Jack broke in.
"All the same you need an army―for hunting. Hunting pigs―"
