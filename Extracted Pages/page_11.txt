"My auntie―"
Then he opened the zipper wi th decision and pulled the whole wind-
breaker over his head.
"There!"
Ralph looked at him sidelong and said nothing.
"I expect we'll w ant to know all their names," said the fat boy , " and make
a list. W e ought to have a meeting."
Ralph did not take the hint so the fat boy was forced to continue.
"I do n't care wh at they call me, " he said confidentially , "so long as they
don't call me what they used to call me at school."
Ralph was faintly interested.
"What was that?"
The fat boy glanced over his shoulder , then leaned toward Ralph.
He whispered.
"They used to call me 'Piggy .'"
Ralph shrieked with laughter . He jumped up.
"Piggy! Piggy!"
"Ralph―please!"
Piggy clasped his hands in apprehension.
"I said I didn't want―"
"Piggy! Piggy!"
