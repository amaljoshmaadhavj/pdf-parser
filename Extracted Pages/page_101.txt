trees."
He paused, and the other littluns laughed in horrified sympathy .
"Then I was frightened and I w oke up. And I was outside the s helter by
myself in the dark and the twisty things had gone away ."
The vivid horror of this, so possible and so nakedly terrifying, held them

"That was a nightmare," said Ralph. "He was walking in his sleep."
The assembly murmured in subdued agreement.
The littlun shook his head stubbornly .
