Piggy shook his head.
"I can't swim. I wasn't allowed. My asthma―"
"Sucks to your ass-mar!"
Piggy b ore this  with a sort of humble patience. "Y ou can't half swim
well."
Ralph paddled backwards down  the slope, immersed his mouth and blew
a jet of water into the air . Then he lifted his chin and spoke.
"I co uld swim w hen I was five.  Daddy taught me. He's a commander in
the Navy . When he gets leave he'll come and rescue us. W hat's your
father?"
Piggy flushed suddenly .
"My dad's dead," he said quickly , "and my mum―"
He took  of f his glasses and loo ked vainly for something with which to
clean them.
"I used to live with my auntie. She kept a candy store. I used to get ever
so many candies. As many as I liked. When'll your dad rescue us?"
"Soon as he can."
Piggy ro se dripp ing from the wa ter and stood naked, cleaning his glasses
with a sock. The only sound tha t reached them now through the  heat of the
morning was the long, grinding roar of the breakers on the reef.
"How does he know we're here?"
Ralph lolled in the water . Sleep enveloped him like the swathing  mirages
that were wrestling with the brilliance of the lagoon.
"How does he know we're here?"
