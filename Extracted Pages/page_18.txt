"―mooed like a cow ," he said. "He had some white stones too, an' a bird
cage with a green parrot. He didn't blow the white stones, of co urse, an' he
said―"
Piggy paused for breath and stroked the glistening thing that lay in
Ralph's hands.
"Ralph!"
      Ralph looked up.
"W e can use this to call the oth ers. Have a meeting. They'll come when
they hear us―"
He beamed at Ralph.
"That was what you meant, didn't you? That's why you got the conch out
of the water?"
Ralph pushed back his fair hair .
"How did your friend blow the conch?"
"He kind of spat," said Piggy . "My auntie wouldn't let me blow on
account of my asthma. He said  you blew from down here." Piggy laid a
hand on his jutting abdomen. "Y ou try , Ralph. Y ou'll call the others."
Doubtfully , Ralp h laid the smal l end of the shell against his m outh and
blew . Th ere cam e a rushing sou nd from its mouth but nothing more. Ralph
wiped th e salt water of f his lip s and tried again, but the shell remained
silent.
"He kind of spat."
Ralph pu rsed his lips and squirted air into the shell, which emit ted a low ,
farting n oise. Th is amused both boys so much that Ralph went on squirting
for some minutes, between bouts of laughter .
"He blew from down here."
