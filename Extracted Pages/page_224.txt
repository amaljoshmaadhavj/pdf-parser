Now Jack was yelling too and  Ralph could no longer make himself
heard. Ja ck had backed right aga inst the tribe and they were a so lid mass of
menace that bristled with spears. The intention of a char ge was forming
among them; they were working  up to it and the neck would be swept clear .
Ralph stood facing them, a little  to one side, his spear ready . B y him stood
Piggy still holding out the talisman, the fragile, shining beauty of the shell.
The stor m of sound beat at them , an incantation of hatred. Hig h overhead,
Roger , w ith a sense of delirious abandonment, leaned all his weight on the
lever .
Ralph heard the great rock before he saw it. He was aware of a jolt in the
earth tha t came to him through t he soles of his feet, and the bre aking sound
of stone s at the top of the clif f. Then the monstrous red thi ng bounded
across the neck and he flung himself flat while the tribe shrieked.
The roc k struck  Piggy a glanc ing blow from chin to knee; the conch
exploded into a thousand white f ragments and ceased to exist. Piggy , saying
nothing, with no time for even a grunt, traveled through the air sideways
from the rock, turning over as he went. The rock bounded tw ice and was
lost in the forest. Piggy fell forty feet and landed on his back  across the
square red rock in the sea. His head opened and stuf f came out  and turned
red. Pigg y's arm s and legs twitched a bit, like a pig's after it has been killed.
Then the sea bre athed again in a  long, slow sigh, the water boiled white and
pink over the rock; and when it went, sucking back again, the body of Piggy
was gone.
This tim e the silence was complete. Ralph's lips formed a word but no
sound came.
Suddenly Jack bounded out from the tribe and began screaming wildly .
"See? See? That's what you'll get! I meant that! There isn't a tribe for you
any more! The conch is gone―"
He ran forward, stooping.
"I'm chief!"
