"Let me speak."
He was standing  in the dust of the fight, and as the tribe saw his intention
the shrill cheer changed to a steady booing.
Piggy h eld up the conch and the booing sagged a little, then came up
again to strength.
"I got the conch!"
He shouted.
"I tell you, I got the conch!"
Surprisingly , the re was silence n ow; the tribe were curious to hear what
amusing thing he might have to say .
Silence and pause; but in the sil ence a curious air -noise, close b y Ralph's
head. H e gave it half his attention―and there it was again; a f aint "Zup!"
Someone was throwing stones: R oger was dropping them, his one hand still
on the lever . Below him, Ralph was a shock of hair and Piggy a bag of fat.
"I got this to sa y . Y ou're acting like a crowd of kids." The booing rose
and died again as Piggy lifted the white, magic shell.
"Which is better―to be a pack of painted Indians like you are, or to be
sensible like Ralph is?"
A great clamor rose among the savages. Piggy shouted again.
"Which is better―to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?"
Again the clamor and again―"Zup!"
Ralph shouted against the noise.
"Which is better , law and rescue, or hunting and breaking things up?"
