"There was lashings of blood," said Jack, laughing and shuddering, "you
should have seen it!"
"W e'll go hunting every day―"
Ralph spoke again, hoarsely . He had not moved.
"Y ou let the fire go out."
This rep etition m ade Jack uneasy . He looked at the twins and t hen back
at Ralph.
"W e had  to have them in the hun t," he said, "or there wouldn't have been
enough for a ring."
He flushed, conscious of a fault.
"The fire's only been out an hour or two. W e can light up again―"
He noticed Ralph's scarred nakedness, and the sombre silence of all four
of th em. He sought, charitable in his happiness, to include them in the thing
that had happened. His mind wa s crowded with memories; memories of the
knowledge that had come to them when they closed in on th e struggling
pig, knowledge that they had o utwitted a living thing, imposed their will
upon it, taken away its life like a long satisfying drink.
He spread his arms wide.
"Y ou should have seen the blood!"
The hun ters wer e more silent n ow , but at this they buzzed again. Ralph
flung ba ck his hair . One arm pointed at the empty horizon. His voice was
loud and savage, and struck them into silence.
"There was aship."
Jack, faced at once with too many awful implications, ducked a way from
them. He laid a hand on the pig  and drew his knife. Ralph brought his arm
down, fist clenched, and his voice shook.
