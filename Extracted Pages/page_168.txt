"Sharpen a stick at both ends."
Presently he stood up, holding the dripping sow's head in his hands.
"Where's that stick?"
"Here."
"Ram one end in the earth. Oh―it's rock. Jam it in that crack. There."
Jack held up the head and jammed the soft throat down on th e pointed
end of the stick which pierced through into the mouth. He stoo d back and
the head hung there, a little blood dribbling down the stick.
Instinctively the boys drew back too; and the forest was very still. They
listened, and the loudest noise was the buzzing of flies over the spilled guts.
Jack spoke in a whisper .
"Pick up the pig."
Maurice and Robert skewered the carcass, lifted the dead weight, and
stood re ady . In the silence, and standing over the dry blood, they looked
suddenly furtive.
Jack spoke loudly .
"This head is for the beast. It's a gift."
The silence accepted the gift and awed them. The head remained there,
dim-eyed, grinning faintly , blood blackening between the teeth. All at once
they were running away , as fast as they could, through the forest toward the
open beach.
Simon stayed where he was, a  small brown image, concealed by the
leaves. E ven if he shut his eyes  the sow's head still remained like an after -
image. T he half- shut eyes were dim with the infinite cynicism of adult life.
They assured Simon that everything was a bad business.
