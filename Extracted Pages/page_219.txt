"Got to? Who says?"
Ralph's temper blazed out.
"I sa y! Y ou voted for me for chief. Didn't you hear the conch? Y ou
played a dirty trick―we'd have given you fire if you'd asked for it―"
The blood was flowing in his cheeks and the bunged-up eye throbbed.
"Y ou could have had fire whenever you wanted. But you didn't. Y ou
came sneaking up like a thief and stole Piggy's glasses!"
"Say that again!"
"Thief! Thief!"
Piggy screamed.
"Ralph! Mind me!"
Jack made a rush and stabbed at Ralph's chest with his spear . Ralph
sensed the position of the weapon from the glimpse he caught of Jack's arm
and put the thrust aside with hi s own butt. Then he brought the end round
and caug ht Jack  a stinger across the ear . They were chest to chest, breathing
fiercely , pushing and glaring.
"Who's a thief?"
"Y ou are!"
Jack wrenched free and swung at Ralph with his spear . By common
consent they were using the spears as sabers now , no longer daring the
lethal points. The blow struc k Ralph's spear and slid down, to fall
agonizingly on his fingers. Then they were apart once more, their positions
reversed, Jack toward the Castle  Rock and Ralph on the outside toward the
island.
Both boys were breathing very heavily .
