Ralph g rasped t he idea and hit  the shell with air from his di aphragm.
Immediately the thing sounded . A deep, harsh note boomed under the
palms, spread through the intricacies of the forest and echoed back from the
pink granite of the mountain. Clouds of birds rose from the treetops, and
something squealed and ran in the under growth.
Ralph took the shell away from his lips.
"Gosh!"
His ordi nary vo ice sounded like a whisper after the harsh note of the
conch. He laid t he conch against his lips, took a deep breath and blew once
more. The note boomed again: and then at his firmer pressure, the note,
fluking u p an octave, became a strident blare more penetrating than before.
Piggy w as shouting something,  his face pleased, his glasses flashing. The
birds cri ed, small animals scuttered. Ralph's breath failed; the note dropped
the octave, became a low wubber , was a rush of air .
The conch was silent, a gleam ing tusk; Ralph's face was d ark with
breathlessness and the air over the island was full of bird-clamor and echoes
ringing.
"I bet you can hear that for miles."
Ralph found his breath and blew a series of short blasts.
Piggy exclaimed: "There's one!"
A child had appeared among the palms, about a hundred yards along the
beach. He was a  boy of perhaps  six years, sturdy and fair , his clothes torn,
his face covered with a sticky m ess of fruit. His trousers had been lowered
for a n ob vious p urpose and had only been pulled back half-way . He jumped
of f the palm terrace into the sand and his trousers fell about his ankles; he
stepped out of them and trotted to the platform. Piggy helped him up.
Meanwhile Ralph continued to blow till voices shouted in the forest. The
small boy squatted in front of Ralph, looking up brightly and vertically . As
he received the reassurance of something purposeful being done he began to
look satisfied, and his only clean digit, a pink thumb, slid into his mouth.
