"Green candles, " said Jack contemptuously . "W e can't eat them. Come
on."
They we re in the beginnings of the thick forest, plonking with w eary feet
on a  track, when they heard the noises―squeakings―and the hard strike of
hoofs on  a path. As they push ed forward the squeaking increased till it
became a frenzy . They found a piglet caught in a curtain o f creepers,
throwing itself at the elastic traces in all the madness of extrem e terror . Its
voice was thin, needle-sharp an d insistent; The three boys rush ed forward
and Jack drew h is knife again with a flourish. He raised his arm  in the air .
There ca me a pause, a hiatus, the pig continued to scream and the creepers
to jerk, and the blade continued to flash at the end of a bony arm. The pause
was onl y long enough for th em to understand what an enormity the
downward stroke would be. Then the piglet tore loose from the creepers and
scurried into the under growth. T hey were left looking at each other and the
place of terror . Jack's face was white under the freckles. He noticed that he
still held  the knife aloft and brought his arm down replacing the blade in the
sheath. T hen the y all three laug hed ashamedly and began to cl imb back to
the track.
"I was choosing a place," said J ack. "I was just waiting for a moment to
decide where to stab him."
"Y ou sh ould stick a pig," said Ralph fiercely . "They always talk about
sticking a pig."
"Y ou cut a pig's throat to let th e blood out," said Jack, "otherwise you
can't eat the meat."
"Why didn't you―?"
They kn ew very well why he hadn't: because of the enormity of  the knife
descending and cutting into living flesh; because of the unbearable blood.
"I was going to," said Jack. He w as ahead of them, and they could not see
his face. "I was choosing a place. Next time―!"
