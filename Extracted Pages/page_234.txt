"W e're going to spread out in a line across the island―"
"―we're going forward from this end―"
"―until we find you."
"W e've got to give signals like this."
Eric rais ed his head and achieved a faint ululation by beating on  his open
mouth. Then he glanced behind him nervously .
"Like that―"
"―only louder , of course."
"But I'v e done nothing," whispered Ralph, ur gently . "I only wanted to
keep up a fire!"
He p aused for a  moment, thinking miserably of the morrow . A matter of
overwhelming importance occurred to him.
"What are you―?"
He could not bring himself to  be specific at first; but then fear and
loneliness goaded him.
"When they find me, what are they going to do?"
The twins were silent. Beneath him, the death rock flowered again.
"What are they―oh God! I'm hungry―"
The towering rock seemed to sway under him.
"W ell―what―?"
The twins answered his question indirectly .
"Y ou got to go now , Ralph."
