"Y ou make a bo w and spin the arrow ," said Roger . He rubbed his hands
in mime. "Psss. Psss."
A little air was moving over the  mountain. Piggy came with it, in shorts
and shir t, laboring cautiously out of the forest with the evening sunlight
gleaming from his glasses. He held the conch under his arm.
Ralph shouted at him.
      "Piggy! Have you got any matches?"
The othe r boys took up the cry  till the mountain rang. Piggy shook his
head and came to the pile.
"My! Y ou've made a big heap, haven't you?"
Jack pointed suddenly .
"His specs―use them as burning glasses!"
Piggy was surrounded before he could back away .
"Here―let me go!" His voice rose to a shriek of terror as Jack snatched
the g lasses of f his face. "Mind out! Give 'em back! I can hardly  see! Y ou'll
break the conch!"
Ralph elbowed him to ne side and knelt by the pile.
"Stand out of the light."
There was pushing and pulling and of ficious cries. Ralph moved the
lenses back and forth, this way and that, till a glossy white image of the
declining sun lay on a piece of r otten wood. Almost at once a thin trickle of
smoke rose up and made him cough. Jack knelt too and blew gently , so that
the s moke drifted away , thickening, and a tiny flame appeared.  The flame,
nearly invisible at first in that bright sunlight, enveloped a small twig, grew ,
was enri ched with color and rea ched up to a branch which exploded with a
sharp crack. The flame flapped higher and the boys broke into a cheer .
