Eric pushed back his hair .
"They'd be better than―"
He wou ld not name people and Sam finished the sentence for him by
nodding along the beach.
Ralph remembered the ungainly figure on a parachute.
"He said something about a dead man." He flushed painfully at this
admission that he had been pres ent at the dance. He made ur ging motions at
the smoke and with his body . "Don't stop―go on up!"
"Smoke's getting thinner ."
"W e need more wood already , even when it's wet."
"My asthma―"
The response was mechanical.
"Sucks to your ass-mar ."
"If I pull logs, I get my asthma bad. I wish I didn't, Ralph, but there it is."
The thre e boys went into the fo rest and fetched armfuls of rott en wood.
Once more the smoke rose, yellow and thick.
"Let's get something to eat."
T ogether they went to the fruit trees, carrying their spears, saying little,
cramming in haste. When they came out of the forest again the sun was
setting and only embers glowed in the fire, and there was no smoke.
"I can't carry any more wood," said Eric. "I'm tired."
Ralph cleared his throat.
"W e kept the fire going up there."
