"Who? Jack?"
"Oh no―"
They bent to him and lowered their voices.
"Push of f, Ralph―"
"―it's a tribe―"
"―they made us―"
"―we couldn't help it―"
When Ralph spoke again his voice was low , and seemed breathless.
"What have I done? I liked him―and I wanted us to be rescued―"
Again the stars spilled about the sky . Eric shook his head, earnestly .
"Listen, Ralph. Never mind what's sense. That's gone―"
"Never mind about the chief―"
"―you got to go for your own good."
"The chief and Roger―"
"―yes, Roger―"
"They hate you, Ralph. They're going to do you."
"They're going to hunt you tomorrow ."
"But why?"
"I dunno. And Ralph, Jack, the chief, says it'll be dangerous―"
"―and we've got to be careful and throw our spears like at a pig."
