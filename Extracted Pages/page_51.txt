"There wasn't any smoke. Only flame."
Piggy had settled himself in a space between two rocks, and sat with the
conch on his knees.
"W e hav en't ma de a fire," he said, "what's any use. W e couldn't keep a
fire like that going, not if we tried."
"A fat lot you tried," said Jack contemptuously . "Y ou just sat."
"W e used his s pecs," said Simon, smearing a black cheek with his
forearm. "He helped that way ."
"I got the conch," said Piggy indignantly . "Y ou let me speak!"
"The con ch doesn't count on top  of the mountain," said Jack, "so you shut
up."
"I got the conch in my hand."
"Put on green b ranches," said Maurice. "That's the best way  to make
smoke."
"I got the conch―"
Jack turned fiercely .
"Y ou shut up!"
Piggy w ilted. Ra lph took the con ch from him and looked round the circle
of boys.
"W e've got to h ave special people for looking after the fire. Any day
there ma y be a ship out there"― he waved his arm at the taut wire of the
horizon―"and if we have a sign al going they'll come and take us of f. And
another thing. W e ought to hav e more rules. Where the conch is, that's a
meeting. The same up here as down there."
