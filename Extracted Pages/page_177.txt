"This is  ridiculous. Y ou know perfectly well you'll only meet me down
there―so don't try to escape!"
Simon's body was arched and s tif f. The Lord of the Flies spoke in the
voice of a schoolmaster .
"This ha s gone quite far enough. My poor , misguided child, do you think
you know better than I do?"
There was a pause.
"I'm war ning yo u. I'm going to get angry . D'you see? Y ou're not wanted.
Understand? W e  are going to have fun on this island. Understand? W e are
going to have fu n on this island!  So don't try it on, my poor misguided boy ,
or else―"
Simon found he was looking into a vast mouth. There was blackness
within, a blackness that spread.
"―Or e lse," sai d the Lord of the Flies, "we shall do you? See? Jack and
Roger a nd Mau rice and Robert and Bill and Piggy and Ralph. Do you.
See?"
Simon was inside the mouth. He fell down and lost consciousness.
