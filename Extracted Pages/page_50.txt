"My specs!" howled Piggy . "Give me my specs!"
Ralph st ood awa y from the pile  and put the glasses into Piggy's groping
hands. His voice subsided to a mutter .
"Jus' blurs, that's all. Hardly see my hand―"
The boy s were dancing. The pile was so rotten, and now so tinder -dry ,
that whole limbs yielded passi onately to the yellow flames that poured
upwards and shook a great bear d of flame twenty feet in the ai r . For yards
round the fire the heat was like a blow , and the breeze was a river of sparks.
T runks crumbled to white dust.
Ralph shouted.
"More wood! All of you get more wood!"
Life became a ra ce with the fire  and the boys scattered through the upper
forest. T o keep  a clean flag of flame flying on the mountain was the
immediate end and no one look ed further . Even the smallest b oys, unless
fruit clai med them, brought little pieces of wood and threw them in. The air
moved a little faster and became a light wind, so that leeward and windward
side wer e clearl y dif ferentiated. On one side the air was cool, but on the
other the fire th rust out a sava ge arm of heat that crinkled hair on the
instant. Boys who felt the evening wind on their damp faces paused to
enjoy th e freshn ess of it and then found they were exhausted.  They flung
themselves down in the shadows that lay among the shattered  rocks. The
beard of  flame diminished quic kly; then the pile fell inwards with a soft,
cindery sound, and sent a great tree of sparks upwards that leane d away and
drifted downwind. The boys lay , panting like dogs.
Ralph raised his head of f his forearms.
"That was no good."
Roger spat ef ficiently into the hot dust.
"What d'you mean?"
