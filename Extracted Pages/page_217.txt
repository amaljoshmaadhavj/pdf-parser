"Y ou mind out―see?"
At length Ralph took his lips aw ay and paused to get his breath back. His
first words were a gasp, but audible.
"―calling an assembly ."
The savages guarding the neck muttered among themselves but made no
motion. Ralph walked forward s a couple of steps. A voice whispered
ur gently behind him.
"Don't leave me, Ralph."
"Y ou kneel down," said Ralph sideways, "and wait till I come back."
He stood halfway along the neck and gazed at the savages intently . Freed
by the paint, they had tied their hair back and were more comf ortable than
he was. Ralph made a resolutio n to tie his own back afterwards. Indeed he
felt like  telling them to wait and doing it there and then; but that was
impossible. The  savages sniggered a bit and one gestured at Ra lph with his
spear . H igh abov e, Roger took his hands of f the lever and leane d out to see
what was going on. The boys on the neck stood in a pool o f their own
shadow , diminished to shaggy heads. Piggy crouched, his back shapeless as
a sack.
"I'm calling an assembly ."
Silence.
Roger to ok up a small stone and flung it between the twins, aiming to
miss. They started and Sam only just kept his footing. Some source of
power began to pulse in Roger's body .
Ralph spoke again, loudly .
"I'm calling an assembly ."
He ran his eye over them.
