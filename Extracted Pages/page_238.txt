Castle Rock, distant and unmenacing. He composed himself triumphantly ,
to hear the sounds of the hunt dying away .
Y et no one made a sound; and a s the minutes passed, in the green shade,
his feeling of triumph faded.
At last he heard a voice―Jack's voice, but hushed.
"Are you certain?"
The savage addressed said nothing. Perhaps he made a gesture.
Roger spoke.
"If you're fooling us―"
Immediately after this, there came a gasp, and a squeal of pain. Ralph
crouched instinc tively . One of th e twins was there, outside the thicket, with
Jack and Roger .
"Y ou're sure he meant in there?"
The twin moaned faintly and then squealed again.
"He meant he'd hide in there?"
"Y es―yes―oh―!"
Silver laughter scattered among the trees.
So they knew .
Ralph picked up his stick and prepared for battle. But what could they
do? It would ta ke them a week  to break a path through the thicket; and
anyone w ho wo rmed his way in would be helpless. He felt the point of his
spear with his th umb and grinned without amusement. Whoev er tried that
would be stuck, squealing like a pig.
