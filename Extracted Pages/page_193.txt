Piggy shook his head.
"Not us till last.  They never not iced in the dark. Anyway you said I was
only on the outside."
"So was I," muttered Ralph, "I was on the outside too."
Piggy nodded eagerly .
"That's r ight. W e was on the outside. W e never done nothing, we never
seen nothing."
Piggy paused, then went on.
"W e'll live on our own, the four of us―"
"Four of us. W e aren't enough to keep the fire burning."
"W e'll try . See? I lit it."
Samneric came dragging a great log out of the forest. They dum ped it by
the fire and turned to the pool. Ralph jumped to his feet.
"Hi! Y ou two!"
The twins checked a moment, then walked on.
"They're going to bathe, Ralph."
"Better get it over ."
The twins were very surprised to see Ralph. They flushed and looked
past him into the air .
"Hullo. Fancy meeting you, Ralph."
"W e just been in the forest―"
"―to get wood for the fire―"
