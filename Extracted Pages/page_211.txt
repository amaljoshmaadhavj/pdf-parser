He paused lamely as the curtain  flickered in his brain. Piggy held out his
hands for the conch.
"What y ou goin' to do, Ralph? This is jus' talk without decidin g. I want
my glasses."
"I'm tryi ng to think. Supposing we go, looking like we used to , washed
and hair brushed―after all we aren't savages really and being rescued isn't a
game―"
He opened the flap of his cheek and looked at the twins.
"W e could smarten up a bit and then go―"
"W e ought to take spears," said Sam. "Even Piggy ."
"―because we may need them."
"Y ou haven't got the conch!"
Piggy held up the shell.
"Y ou can take s pears if you wan t but I shan't. What's the good? I'll have
to be  led like a d og, anyhow . Y es, laugh. Go on, laugh. There's them on this
island as would laugh at anythi ng. And what happened? What's grownups
goin' to think? Y oung Simon was murdered. And there was that other kid
what had a mark on his face. Who's seen him since we first come here?"
"Piggy! Stop a minute!"
"I got the conch. I'm going to that Jack Merridew an' tell him, I am."
"Y ou'll get hurt."
"What c an he do more than he h as? I'll tell him what's what. Y ou let me
carry the conch, Ralph. I'll show him the one thing he hasn't got."
Piggy p aused fo r a moment an d peered round at the dim figures. The
shape of the old assembly , trodden in the grass, listened to him.
