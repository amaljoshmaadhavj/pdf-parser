"Up there it was small. But this has got to be a big one."
Ralph ca rried a fragment to the fire and watched the smoke th at drifted
into the dusk.
"W e've got to keep it going."
Eric flung himself down.
"I'm too tired. And what's the good?"
"Eric!" cried Ralph in a shocked voice. "Don't talk like that!"
Sam knelt by Eric.
"W ell―what is the good?"
Ralph tried indignantly to remember . There was something good about a
fire. Something overwhelmingly good.
"Ralph's told you often enough, " said Piggy moodily . "How else are we
going to be rescued?"
"Of course! If we don't make smoke―"
He squatted before them in the crowding dusk.
"Don't y ou understand? What' s the good of wishing for radios and
boats?"
He held out his hand and twisted the fingers into a fist. "There's only one
thing we  can do to get out of this mess. Anyone can play at hunting, anyone
can get us meat―"
He look ed from face to face. Th en, at the moment of greatest passion and
conviction, that curtain flapped in his head and he for got what he had been
driving at. He knelt there, his fist clenched, gazing solemnly from one to the
other . Then the curtain whisked back.
