V iciously , with full intention, he  hurled his spear at Ralph. The point tore
the skin  and flesh over Ralph's ribs, then sheared of f and fell i n the water .
Ralph stumbled, feeling not pain but panic, and the tribe, screaming now
like the chief, began to advance . Another spear , a bent one that would not
fly s traight, went past his face and one fell from on high where  Roger was.
The twi ns lay hidden behind t he tribe and the anonymous devils' faces
swarmed across  the neck. Ralph turned and ran. A great noise as of sea
gulls rose behind him. He obeyed an instinct that he did no t know he
possessed and swerved over the  open space so that the spears went wide.
He saw the headless body of t he sow and jumped in time. Then he was
crashing through foliage and small boughs and was hidden by the forest.
The chief stopped by the pig, turned and held up his hands.
"Back! Back to the fort!"
Presently the tribe returned noisily to the neck where Roger joined them.
The chief spoke to him angrily .
"Why aren't you on watch?"
Roger looked at him gravely .
"I just came down―"
The han gman's horror clung round him. The chief said no more to him
but looked down at Samneric.
"Y ou got to join the tribe."
"Y ou lemme go―"
"―and me."
The chie f snatch ed one of the few spears that were left and poked Sam in
the ribs.
