Jack's arm came down; the hea ving circle cheered and made pig-dying
noises. T hen they lay quiet, pant ing, listening to Robert's frightened snivels.
He wiped his face with a dirty arm, and made an ef fort to retrieve his status.
"Oh, my bum!"
He rubbed his rump ruefully . Jack rolled over .
"That was a good game."
"Just a game," said Ralph uneasily . "I got jolly badly hurt at rugger
once."
"W e ought to have a drum," said Maurice, "then we could do it properly ."
Ralph looked at him.
"How properly?"
"I dunno. Y ou want a fire, I think, and a drum, and you keep time to the
drum.
"Y ou want a pig," said Roger , "like a real hunt."
"Or som eone to pretend," said Jack. "Y ou could get someone to dress up
as a pig and then  he could act― you know , pretend to knock me over and all
that."
"Y ou wa nt a real pig," said Robert, still caressing his rump, "because
you've got to kill him."
"Use a littlun," said Jack, and everybody laughed.
Ralph sat up.
"W ell. W e shan't find what we're looking for at this rate."
One by one they stood up, twitching rags into place.
