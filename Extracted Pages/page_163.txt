"Where's Simon?"
"I don't know ."
"Y ou don't think he's climbing the mountain?"
Piggy br oke into  noisy laughter and took more fruit. "He might be." He
gulped his mouthful. "He's cracked."
Simon h ad passe d through the area of fruit trees but today the littluns had
been too busy with the fire on the beach and they had not pursued him
there. He went on among the creepers until he reached the gre at mat that
was woven by the open space and crawled inside. Beyond the screen of
leaves the sunlight pelted down  and the butterflies danced in  the middle
their unending dance. He knelt down and the arrow of the sun fell on him.
That oth er time  the air had seemed to vibrate with heat; but now it
threatened. Soon the sweat was running from his long coarse hair . He
shifted restlessl y but there was no avoiding the sun. Presen tly he was
thirsty , and then very thirsty . He continued to sit.
Far of f along the  beach, Jack was standing before a small group of boys.
He was looking brilliantly happy .
"Hunting," he said. He sized the m up. Each of them wore the re mains of
a bl ack cap and ages ago they had stood in two demure row s and their
voices had been the song of angels.
"W e'll hunt. I'm going to be chief."
They nodded, and the crisis passed easily .
"And then―about the beast."
They moved, looked at the forest.
"I say this. W e aren't going to bother about the beast."
He nodded at them.
