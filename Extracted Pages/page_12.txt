Ralph danced out into the hot air of the beach and then returned as a
fighter -plane, with wings swept back, and machine-gunned Piggy .
"Sche-aa-ow!"
He dived in the sand at Piggy's feet and lay there laughing.
"Piggy!"
Piggy g rinned reluctantly , pleased despite himself at even this much
recognition.
"So long as you don't tell the others―"
Ralph giggled into the sand. The expression of pain and concentration
returned to Piggy's face.
"Half a sec'."
He hastened back into the forest . Ralph stood up and trotted along to the
right.
Here th e beach was interrupted abruptly by the square motif of the
landscape; a great platform of  pink granite thrust up uncom promisingly
through forest and terrace and sand and lagoon to make a raise d jetty four
feet high . The top of this was c overed with a thin layer of soil and coarse
grass and shaded with young palm trees. There was not enough soil for
them to grow to any height and when they reached perhaps twen ty feet they
fell and dried, forming a criss-cross pattern of trunks, very convenient to sit
on. T he palms that still stood made a green roof, covered on the underside
with a quivering tangle of reflections from the lagoon. Ralph hauled himself
onto this platform, noted the coolness and shade, shut one eye, and decided
that the shadow s on his body were really green. He picked his  way to the
seaward edge of the platform and stood looking down into the water . It was
clear to the bottom and bright w ith the ef florescence of tropical weed and
coral. A  school of tiny , glittering fish flicked hither and thither . R alph spoke
to himself, sounding the bass strings of delight.
