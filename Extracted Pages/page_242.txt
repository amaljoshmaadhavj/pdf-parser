There w ere man y things he could do. He could climb a tree; but that was
putting all his e ggs in one basket. If he were detected, they had nothing
more dif ficult to do than wait.
If only one had time to think!
Another double cry at the same distance gave him a clue to their plan.
Any savage balked in the fores t would utter the double shout and hold up
the l ine till he was free again. That way they might hope to keep the cordon
unbroken right across the island . Ralph thought of the boar that had broken
through them with such ease. If necessary , when the chase came too close,
he c ould char ge the cordon while it was still thin, burst through, and run
back. Bu t run back where? The cordon would turn and sweep ag ain. Sooner
or later he wou ld have to sleep or eat―and then he would a waken with
hands clawing at him; and the hunt would become a running down.
What was to be  done, then? Th e tree? Burst the line like a boar? Either
way the choice was terrible.
A si ngle cry quickened his hea rt-beat and, leaping up, he dash ed away
toward the ocean side and the  thick jungle till he was hung up among
creepers; he stayed there for a moment with his calves quivering. If only
one could have quiet, a long pause, a time to think!
And there again, shrill and inev itable, was the ululation sweeping across
the i sland. At that sound he shied like a horse among the creep ers and ran
once mo re till he was panting. He flung himself down by som e ferns. The
tree, or the char ge? He mastered his breathing for a moment, wiped his
mouth, a nd told himself to be ca lm. Samneric were somewhere  in that line,
and hating it. Or were they? And supposing, instead of them,  he met the
chief, or Roger who carried death in his hands?
Ralph pushed back his tangled hair and wiped the sweat out of his best
eye. He spoke aloud.
"Think."
What was the sensible thing to do?
