smoke w as clim bing into the sk y . Simon, for getful of the flies , shaded his
eyes with both hands and peered  at the smoke. Even at that dis tance it was
possible to see t hat most of the boys―perhaps all of the boys―were there.
So they had shifted camp then, a way from the beast. As Simon thought this,
he turned to the poor broken thing that sat stinking by his side. The beast
was harmless and horrible; and  the news must reach the others as soon as
possible. He started down the mountain and his legs gave beneath him.
Even with great care the best he could do was a stagger .
"Bathing," said Ralph, "that's the only thing to do." Piggy was i nspecting
the looming-sky through his glass. "I don't like them clouds. Remember
how it rained just after we landed?"
"Going to rain again."
Ralph d ived into  the pool. A couple of littluns were playing at the edge,
trying to  extract  comfort from a  wetness warmer than blood. Pig gy took of f
his glass es, stepped primly into t he water and then put them on a gain. Ralph
came to the surface and squirted a jet of water at him.
"Mind my specs," said Piggy . "If I get water on the glass I got to get out
and clean 'em."
Ralph squirted again and missed . He laughed at Piggy , expectin g him to
retire m eekly as  usual and in pained silence. Instead, Piggy be at the water
with his hands.
"Stop it!" he shouted. "D'you hear?"
Furiously he drove the water into Ralph's face.
"All right, all right," said Ralph. "Keep your hair on."
Piggy stopped beating the water .
"I got a pain in my head. I wish the air was cooler ."
"I wish the rain would come."
