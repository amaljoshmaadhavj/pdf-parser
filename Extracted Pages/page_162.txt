"I se en them ste aling of f when we was gathering wood. They went that
way . The same way as he went himself."
Ralph fi nished h is inspection and looked up into the air . The sk y , as if in
sympathy with the great changes among them, was dif ferent to day and so
misty that in som e places the hot air seemed white. The disc of the sun was
dull silver as though it were nearer and not so hot, yet the air stifled.
"They always been making trouble, haven't they?"
The voice came near his shoulder and sounded anxious. "W e can do
without 'em. W e'll be happier now , won't we?"
Ralph sat. The twins came, dragging a great log and grinning in their
triumph. They dumped the log among the embers so that sparks flew .
"W e can do all right on our own, can't we?"
For a long time while the log dried, caught fire and turned red hot, Ralph
sat in the sand and said nothing. He did not see Piggy go to the twins and
whisper to them, nor how the three boys went together into the forest.
"Here you are."
He cam e to himself with a jolt . Piggy and the other two were by him.
They were laden with fruit.
"I thought perhaps," said Piggy , "we ought to have a feast, kind of."
The thre e boys sat down. They  had a great mass of the fruit with them
and all of it properly ripe. They grinned at Ralph as he took some and began
to eat.
"Thanks," he said. Then with an accent of pleased surprise―"Thanks!"
"Do all right on our own," said Piggy . "It's them that haven't no  common
sense that make trouble on this island. W e'll make a little hot fire―"
Ralph remembered what had been worrying him.
