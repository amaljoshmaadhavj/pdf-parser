his stomach and pretended not  to see. The mirages had died away and
gloomily he ran his eye along the taut blue line of the horizon.
The next moment he was on his feet and shouting.
"Smoke! Smoke!"
Simon tr ied to sit up in the wate r and got a mouthful. Maurice,  who had
been standing ready to dive, swayed back on his heels, made a bolt for the
platform, then swerved back to the grass under the palms. There he started
to pull on his tattered shorts, to be ready for anything.
Ralph stood, one hand holding back his hair , the other clenche d. Simon
was climbing out of the water . Piggy was rubbing his glasses o n his shorts
and squi nting at  the sea. Maurice had got both legs through on e leg of his
shorts. Of all the boys, only Ralph was still.
"I ca n't see no smoke," said Piggy incredulously . "I can't see n o smoke,
Ralph―where is it?"
Ralph said nothing. Now both h is hands were clenched over his  forehead
so that the fair h air was kept ou t of his eyes. He was leaning forward and
already the salt was whitening his body .
"Ralph―where's the ship?"
Simon stood by , looking from Ralph to the horizon. Maurice's trousers
gave way with a  sigh and he abandoned them as a wreck, rushed  toward the
forest, and then came back again.
The smoke was a tight little knot on the horizon and was uncoiling
slowly . Beneath the smoke was a dot that might be a funnel. Ralph's face
was pale as he spoke to himself.
"They'll see our smoke."
Piggy was looking in the right direction now .
"It don't look much."
