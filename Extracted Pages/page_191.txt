"Uh?"
"That was Simon."
"Y ou said that before."
"Piggy ."
"Uh?"
"That was murder ."
"Y ou sto p it!" said Piggy , shrill y . "What good're you doing talking like
that?"
He jumped to his feet and stood over Ralph.
"It was dark. T here was that―that bloody dance. There was lightning
and thunder and rain. W e was scared!"
"I wasn't scared," said Ralph slowly , "I was―I don't know what I was."
"W e was  scared!" said Piggy excitedly . "Anything might have h appened.
It wasn't―what you said."
He was gesticulating, searching for a formula.
"Oh, Piggy!"
Ralph's voice, low and stricken, stopped Piggy's gestures. He bent down
and waited. Ralph, cradling the conch, rocked himself to and fro.
"Don't you understand, Piggy? The things we did―"
"He may still be―"
"No."
