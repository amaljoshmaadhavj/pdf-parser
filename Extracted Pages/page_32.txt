The pink  granite of the next clif f was further back from the cre epers and
trees so that they could trot up the path. This again led into  more open
forest so  that they had a glimpse of the spread sea. W ith openne ss came the
sun; it dried the sweat that had soaked their clothes in the dark, damp heat.
At last the way to the top look ed like a scramble over pink rock, with no
more plunging through darkness . The boys chose their way through defiles
and over heaps of sharp stone.
"Look! Look!"
High ov er this end of the island , the shattered rocks lifted up their stacks
and chim neys. This one, against which Jack leaned, moved wi th a grating
sound when they pushed.
"Come on―"
But not "Come o n" to the top. The assault on the summit must w ait while
the three  boys accepted this ch allenge. The rock was as lar ge  as a small
motor car .
"Heave!"
Sway back and forth, catch the rhythm.
"Heave!"
Increase the swing of the pendulum, increase, increase, come up  and bear
against that point of furthest balance― increase―increase― "Heave!"
The grea t rock loitered, poised on one toe, decided not to retur n, moved
through the air , fell, struck, turned over , leapt droning through the air and
smashed a deep hole in the canopy of the forest. Echoes and birds flew ,
white and pink dust floated, the forest further down shook as with the
passage of an enraged monster: and then the island was still.
"W acco!"
"Like a bomb!"
