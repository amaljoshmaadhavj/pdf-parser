"T oo many things."
There came a mutter of agreement. Ralph overrode them.
"And an other thing. W e nearly s et the whole island on fire. And we waste
time, rolling rocks, and making little cooking fires. Now I say this and
make it a rule, b ecause I'm chief. W e won't have a fire anywhere but on the
mountain. Ever ."
There was a ro w immediately . Boys stood up and shouted a nd Ralph
shouted back.
"Because if you want a fire to cook fish or crab, you can jolly well go up
the mountain. That way we'll be certain."
Hands were reaching for the conch in the light of the setting sun. He held
on and leapt on the trunk.
"All this  I meant to say . Now I've said it. Y ou voted me for chief. Now
you do what I say ."
They qu ieted, sl owly , and at last  were seated again. Ralph dropped down
and spoke in his ordinary voice.
"So rem ember . T he rocks for a lavatory . Keep the fire going and smoke
showing as a sig nal. Don't take fire from the mountain. T ake your food up
there."
Jack stood up, scowling in the gloom, and held out his hands.
"I haven't finished yet."
"But you've talked and talked!"
"I've got the conch."
Jack sat down, grumbling.
"Then the last thing. This is what people can talk about."
