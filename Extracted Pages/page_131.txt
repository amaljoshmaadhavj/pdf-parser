He sucked his bruised fist.
"Jack! Come on."
But Jack  was not there. A knot of boys, making a great noise that he had
not noti ced, were heaving and pushing at a rock. As he turne d, the base
cracked and the whole mass top pled into the sea so that a thunderous plume
of spray leapt half-way up the clif f.
"Stop it! Stop it!"
His voice struck a silence among them.
"Smoke."
A strange thing happened in his head. Something flittered ther e in front
of his mind like a bat's wing, obscuring his idea.
"Smoke."
At once the ideas were back, and the anger .
"W e want smoke. And you go wasting your time. Y ou roll rocks."
Roger shouted.
"W e've got plenty of time!"
Ralph shook his head.
"W e'll go to the mountain."
The clamor broke out. Some of the boys wanted to go back to the beach.
Some wanted to roll more rocks . The sun was bright and danger had faded
with the darkness.
"Jack. The beast might be on th e other side. Y ou can lead again. Y ou've
been."
