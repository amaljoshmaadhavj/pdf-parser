He gave  a wild whoop and leapt down to the pale sand. At once the
platform was full of noise and excitement, scramblings, screams and
laughter . The assembly shredded  away and became a discursive and random
scatter from the palms to the water and away along the bea ch, beyond
night-sight. Ralph found his cheek touching the conch and t ook it from
Piggy .
"What's grownups going to say?" cried Piggy again. "Look at 'em!"
The sound of mo ck hunting, hysterical laughter and real terror c ame from
the beach.
"Blow the conch, Ralph."
Piggy was so close that Ralph could see the glint of his one glass.
"There's the fire. Can't they see?"
"Y ou got to be tough now . Make 'em do what you want."
Ralph answered in the cautious voice of one who rehearses a theorem.
"If I blow the conch and they don't come back; then we've had it. W e
shan't keep the fire going. W e'll be like animals. W e'll never be rescued."
"If y ou don't blo w , we'll soon be  animals anyway . I can't see what they're
doing but I can hear ."
The dispersed figures had come together on the sand and were a dense
black mass that revolved. They were chanting something and littluns that
had had enough were staggering away , howling. Ralph raised t he conch to
his lips and then lowered it.
"The trouble is: Are there ghosts, Piggy? Or beasts?"
"Course there aren't."
"Why not?"
