      "Percival W emys Madiso n. The V icarage, Harcourt St. Anthony ,
Hants, telephone, telephone, tele―"
As i f this inform ation was rooted far down in the springs of sorrow , the
littlun w ept. Hi s face puckered, the tears leapt from his eyes, his mouth
opened t ill they could see a squa re black hole. At first he was a silent ef figy
of so rrow; but then the lamentation rose out of him, loud and sustained as
the conch.
"Shut up, you! Shut up!"
Percival W emys Madison would  not shut up. A spring had bee n tapped,
far beyo nd the reach of authority or even physical intimidation.  The crying
went on, breath after breath, an d seemed to sustain him upright as if he
were nailed to it.
"Shut up! Shut up!"
For now the littluns were no longer silent. They were reminded of their
personal sorrow s; and perhaps f elt themselves to share in a sorrow that was
universal. They began to cry in sympathy , two of them almost as loud as
Percival.
Maurice saved them. He cried out.
"Look at me!"
He pretended to fall over . He ru bbed his rump and sat on the twister so
that he fell in the grass. He downed badly; but Percival and the others
noticed and snif fed and laughed. Presently they were all laughing so
absurdly that the biguns joined in.
Jack was the fir st to make hims elf heard. He had not got the conch and
thus spoke against the rules; but nobody minded.
"And what about the beast?"
Something strange was happenin g to Percival. He yawned and staggered,
so that Jack seized and shook him.
