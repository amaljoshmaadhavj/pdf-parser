CHAPTER EIGHT
     
Gift for the Darkness
     
Piggy looked up miserably from the dawn-pale beach to the dark mountain.
"Are you sure? Really sure, I mean?"
I told you a dozen times now ," said Ralph, "we saw it."
"D'you think we're safe down here?"
"How the hell should I know?"
Ralph jerked away from him and walked a few paces along the beach.
Jack was kneeling and drawin g a circular pattern in the sand with his
forefinger . Piggy's voice came to them, hushed.
"Are you sure? Really?"
"Go up and see," said Jack contemptuously , "and good riddance."
"No fear ."
"The beast had teeth," said Ralph, "and big black eyes."
He shud dered violently . Piggy took of f his one round of glass and
polished the surface.
"What we going to do?"
Ralph turned toward the platform. The conch glimmered among the trees,
a white blob against the place w here the sun would rise. He pushed back his
mop.
