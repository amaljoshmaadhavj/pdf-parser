"Y es?"
"Y ou came along part of this shore―below the mountain, beyond there."
"Y es."
"And then?"
"I found a pig-run. It went for miles."
"So the pig-run must be somewhere in there."
Ralph nodded. He pointed at the forest.
Everybody agreed, sagely .
"All right then. W e'll smash a way through till we find the pig-run."
He took a step and halted.
"W ait a minute though! Where does the pig-run go to?"
"The mountain," said Jack, "I told you." He sneered. "Don't you want to
go to the mountain?"
Ralph si ghed, sensing the rising antagonism, understanding tha t this was
how Jack felt as soon as he ceased to lead.
"I was thinking of the light. W e'll be stumbling about."
"W e were going to look for the beast."
"There won't be enough light."
"I don't mind going," said Jack hotly . "I'll go when we get there. W on't
you? W ould you rather go back to the shelters and tell Piggy?"
Now it was Ral ph's turn to flush but he spoke despairingly , out of the
new understanding that Piggy had given him.
