The shivering, silvery , unreal l aughter of the savages sprayed out and
echoed away . A gust of rage shook Ralph. His voice cracked.
"Don't you understand, you pain ted fools? Sam, Eric, Piggy and  me―we
aren't enough. W e tried to keep the fire going, but we couldn't. And then
you, playing at hunting...."
He pointed past them to where the trickle of smoke dispersed in the
pearly air .
"Look a t that! Call that a signal fire? That's a cooking fire. Now you'll eat
and there'll be n o smoke. Don't you understand? There may b e a ship out
there―"
He paus ed, defeated by the silence and the painted anonymi ty of the
group g uarding the entry . Jack opened a pink mouth and addressed
Samneric, who were between him and his tribe.
"Y ou two. Get back."
No o ne answered him. The twi ns, puzzled, looked at each oth er; while
Piggy , reassured  by the cessation of violence, stood up car efully . Jack
glanced back at Ralph and then at the twins.
"Grab them!"
No one moved. Jack shouted angrily .
"I said 'grab them'!"
The painted group moved round Samneric nervously and unhandily .
Once more the silvery laughter scattered.
Samneric protested out of the heart of civilization.
"Oh, I say!"
"―honestly!"
