"Hey―Eric!"
Presently all was quiet again.
Piggy spoke softly to Ralph.
"W e got to get out of this."
"What d'you mean?"
"Get rescued."
For the first time that day , and  despite the crowding blackness, Ralph
sniggered.
"I mean it," whispered Piggy . "If we don't get home soon we'll be barmy ."
"Round the bend."
"Bomb happy ."
"Crackers;"
Ralph pushed the damp tendrils of hair out of his eyes.
"Y ou write a letter to your auntie."
Piggy considered this solemnly .
"I don't know where she is now . And I haven't got an envelope and a
stamp. An' there isn't a mailbox. Or a postman."
The suc cess of his tiny joke overcame Ralph. His sniggers  became
uncontrollable, his body jumped and twitched.
Piggy rebuked him with dignity .
"I haven't said anything all that funny ."
