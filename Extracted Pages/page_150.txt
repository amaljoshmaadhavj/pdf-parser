Now that his physical voice was silent the inner voice of reason, and

forest and pushed their rags against them.
Ralph stirred.
"Come on."
They crept forward, Roger lagging a little. Jack and Ralph turned the
shoulder of the mountain togeth er . The glittering lengths of the lagoon lay
below them and beyond that a long white smudge that was the  reef. Roger
joined them.
Jack whispered.
"Let's creep forward on hands and knees. Maybe it's asleep."

brave words. They came to the  flat top where the rock was ha rd to hands
and knees.

hump―see?"
