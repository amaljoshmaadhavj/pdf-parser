He waited till the platform was very still.
"Things are breaking up. I don't understand why . W e began well; we
were happy . And then―"
He moved the conch gently , looking beyond them at nothing,
remembering the beastie, the snake, the fire, the talk of fear .
"Then people started getting frightened."
A murmur , almost a moan, rose and passed away . Jack had  stopped
whittling. Ralph went on, abruptly .
"But tha t's littlun s' talk. W e'll get that straight. So the last part, the bit we
can all talk about, is kind of deciding on the fear ."
The hair was creeping into his eyes again.
"W e've got to t alk about this fear and decide there's nothing in it. I'm
frightened myself, sometimes; only that's nonsense! Like bogies. Then,
when we've decided, we can sta rt again and be careful about things like the
fire." A picture of three boys wa lking along the bright beach fli tted through
his mind. "And be happy ."
Ceremonially , Ralph laid the conch on the trunk beside him as a  sign that
the speech was over . What sunlight reached them was level.
Jack stood up and took the conch.
"So this  is a me eting to find out what's what. I'll tell you what's what.
Y ou littluns started all this, with the fear talk. Beasts! Where from? Of
course we're frightened sometim es but we put up with being frightened.
Only Ralph says you scream in the night. What does that mean but
nightmares? An yway , you don't hunt or build or help―you're a lot of cry-
babies and sissies. That's what. And as for the fear―you'll hav e to put up
with that like the rest of us."
Ralph looked at Jack open-mouthed, but Jack took no notice.
