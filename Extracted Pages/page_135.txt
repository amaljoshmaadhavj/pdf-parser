Simon n odded a s he spoke. He was kneeling on one knee, looking down
from a higher ro ck which he held with both hands; his other l eg stretched
down to Ralph's level.
Ralph was puzzled and searched Simon's face for a clue.
"It's so big, I mean―"
Simon nodded.
"All the same. Y ou'll get back all right. I think so, anyway ."
Some of  the strain had gone from Ralph's body . He glanced at th e sea and
then smiled bitterly at Simon.
"Got a ship in your pocket?"
Simon grinned and shook his head.
"How do you know , then?"
When Simon was still silent Ralph said curtly , "Y ou're batty ."
Simon s hook his head violently till the coarse black hair flew b ackwards
and forwards across his face.
"No, I'm not. I just think you'll get back all right. "
For a moment nothing more was said. And then they suddenly smiled at
each other .
Roger called from the coverts.
"Come and see!"
The ground was turned over ne ar the pig-run and there were droppings
that steamed. Jack bent down to them as though he loved them.
