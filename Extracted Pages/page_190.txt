"What you say?"
Ralph spoke up.
"Simon."
Piggy said nothing but nodded,  solemnly . They continued to s it, gazing
with imp aired s ight at the chief 's seat and the glittering lagoon . The green
light and the glossy patches of sunshine played over their befouled bodies.
At length Ralph got up and went to the conch. He took the shell
caressingly with both hands and knelt, leaning against the trunk.
"Piggy ."
"Uh?"
"What we going to do?"
Piggy nodded at the conch.
"Y ou could―"
"Call an assembly?"
Ralph laughed sharply as he said the word and Piggy frowned.
"Y ou're still chief."
Ralph laughed again.
"Y ou are. Over us."
"I got the conch."
"Ralph! Stop laughing like that.  Look, there ain't no need, Ralph! What's
the others going to think?"
At last Ralph stopped. He was shivering.
