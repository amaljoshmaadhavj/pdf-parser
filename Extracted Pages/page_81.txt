Simon a nd Maurice arrived. Ralph looked at them with unwinking eyes.
Simon t urned away , smearing the water from his cheeks. Ralph reached
inside himself for the worst word he knew .
"They let the bloody fire go out."
He look ed down  the unfriendly side of the mountain. Piggy arrived, out
of breat h and whimpering like a littlun. Ralph clenched his fist and went
very red . The intentness of his gaze, the bitterness of his voice, pointed for
him.
"There they are."
A pr ocession had appeared, far down among the pink stones that lay near
the water's edge. Some of the bo ys wore black caps but otherwis e they were
almost n aked. T hey lifted sticks in the air together whenever they came to
an easy patch. T hey were chanting, something to do with the bun dle that the
errant tw ins carr ied so carefully . Ralph picked out Jack easily , even at that
distance, tall, red-haired, and inevitably leading the procession.
Simon looked now , from Ralph to Jack, as he had looked from Ralph to
the horizon, and what he saw seemed to make him afraid. Ralph said
nothing more, but waited while the procession came nearer . Th e chant was
audible but at th at distance still wordless. Behind Jack walked  the twins,
carrying a great stake on their shoulders. The gutted carcass of a pig swung
from the stake, swinging heavily as the twins toiled over the uneven
ground. The pig's head hung down with gaping neck and seemed to search
for something on the ground. At last the words of the chant floated up to
them, across the bowl of blackened wood and ashes.
" Kill the pig. Cut her thr oat. Spill her blood. "
Y et as the words  became audible, the procession reached the ste epest part
of the mountain, and in a minu te or two the chant had died away . Piggy
sniveled and Simon shushed him quickly as though he had spoken too
loudly in church.
