They se t of f along the beach in  formation. Ralph went first, l imping a
little, his spear c arried over one shoulder . He saw things partially , through
the trem ble of the heat haze ove r the flashing sands, and his own long hair
and inju ries. Behind him came the twins, worried now for a w hile but full
of u nquenchabl e vitality . They said little but trailed the butts of their
wooden spears; for Piggy had found that, by looking down and shielding his
tired sight from the sun, he could just see these moving along t he sand. He
walked between  the trailing b utts, therefore, the conch held carefully
between his two hands. The boys made a compact little group that moved
over the beach, four plate-like shadows dancing and mingling beneath
them. T here wa s no sign left of the storm, and the beach was swept clean
like a blade that has been scou red. The sky and the mountain  were at an
immense distance, shimmering in the heat; and the reef was lifted by
mirage, floating in a kind of silver pool halfway up the sky .
They pa ssed the  place where the  tribe had danced. The charred sticks still
lay on the rocks where the rai n had quenched them but the sand by the
water w as smoo th again. They passed this in silence. No one d oubted that
the tribe would b e found at the Castle Rock and when they cam e in sight of
it th ey s topped with one accord.  The densest tangle on the island, a mass of
twisted stems, black and green and impenetrable, lay on their left and tall
grass swayed before them. Now Ralph went forward.
Here was the crushed grass whe re they had all lain when he ha d gone to
prospect. There was the neck o f land, the ledge skirting the rock, up there
were the red pinnacles.
Sam touched his arm.
"Smoke."
There was a tiny  smudge of smo ke wavering into the air on the other side
of the rock.
"Some fire―I don't think."
Ralph turned.
