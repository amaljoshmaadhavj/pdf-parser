By the time Ralp h had reached t he landward end of the scar he was using
precious breath to swear . He did desperate violence to his naked body
among the rasping creepers so that blood was sliding over him. Just where
the steep ascent of the mountain  began, he stopped. Maurice wa s only a few
yards behind him.
"Piggy's specs!" shouted Ralph. "If the fire's all out, we'll need them―"
He s topped shouting and swayed  on his feet. Piggy was only ju st visible,
bumbling up from the beach. Ralph looked at the horizon, then up to the
mountain. W as it better to fetch Piggy's glasses, or would the ship have
gone? Or if they  climbed on, sup posing the fire was all out, and they had to
watch Piggy crawling nearer and the ship sinking under the horizon?
Balanced on a high peak of need, agonized by indecision, Ralph cried out:
"Oh God, oh God!"
Simon, struggli ng with the bushes, caught his breath. His face was
twisted. Ralph blundered on, savaging himself, as the wisp of smoke moved
on.
The fire was dead. They saw that straight away; saw what they h ad really
known d own on the beach when the smoke of home had beckon ed. The fire
was out, smokeless and dead; th e watchers were gone. A pile of unused fuel
lay ready .
Ralph turned to the sea. The h orizon stretched, impersonal on ce more,
barren o f all but the faintest trace of smoke. Ralph ran stumbling along the
rocks, saved himself on the edge of the pink clif f, and screamed at the ship.
"Come back! Come back!"
He ran backward s and forwards along the clif f, his face always t o the sea,
and his voice rose insanely .
"Come back! Come back!"
