Piggy's voice trailed of f at the sight of Ralph's face.
"Y ou we re outside. Outside the circle. Y ou never really came in. Didn't

There w as loath ing, and at the same time a kind of feverish ex citement,

"Didn't you see, Piggy?"
"Not all that well. I only got one eye now . Y ou ought to know that,
Ralph."
Ralph continued to rock to and fro.
"It was an accident," said Piggy suddenly , "that's what it was. An
accident." His voice shrilled a gain. "Coming in the dark―he hadn't no
business crawling like that out of the dark. He was batty . He asked for it."
He gesticulated widely again. "It was an accident."
"Y ou didn't see what they did―"
"Look, R alph. W e got to for get this. W e can't do no good think ing about
it, see?"
"I'm frightened. Of us. I want to go home. Oh God, I want to go home."
"It was an accident," said Piggy stubbornly , "and that's that."
He touched Ralph's bare shoul der and Ralph shuddered at th e human
contact.
"And l ook, Ralph"―Piggy glanced round quickly , then leaned
close―"don't let on we was in that dance. Not to Samneric."
"But we were! All of us!"
