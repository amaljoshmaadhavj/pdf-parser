"I'm goi ng to him with this con ch in my hands. I'm going to ho ld it out.
Look, I' m goin' to say , you're  stronger than I am and you haven't got
asthma. Y ou can see, I'm goin' to say , and with both eyes. But I don't ask for
my glasses back, not as a favor . I don't ask you to be a sport, I'll say , not
because you're strong, but because what's right's right. Give me my glasses,
I'm going to say―you got to!"
Piggy en ded, flushed and trembling. He pushed the conch quickly into
Ralph's hands as though in a hurry to be rid of it and wiped the tears from
his e yes. The green light was gentle about them and the conch la y at Ralph's
feet, fragile and white. A single drop of water that had escaped Piggy's
fingers now flashed on the delicate curve like a star .
At last Ralph sat up straight and drew back his hair .
"All right. I mean―you can try if you like. W e'll go with you."
"He'll be painted," said Sam, timidly . "Y ou know how he'll be―"
"―he won't think much of us―"
"―if he gets waxy we've had it―"
Ralph scowled at Sam. Dimly he remembered something Simon had said
to him once, by the rocks.
"Don't be silly ," he said. And then he added quickly , "Let's go."
He held out the conch to Piggy who flushed, this time with pride.
"Y ou must carry it."
"When we're ready I'll carry it―"
Piggy so ught in his mind for words to convey his passionate w illingness
to carry the conch against all odds.
"I don't mind. I'll be glad, Ralph, only I'll have to be led."
