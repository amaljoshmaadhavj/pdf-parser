A voice whispered horribly outside.
"Piggy―Piggy―"
"It's come!" gasped Piggy . "It's real!"
He clung to Ralph and reached to get his breath.
"Piggy , come outside. I want you, Piggy ."
Ralph's mouth was against Piggy's ear .
"Don't say anything."
"Piggy―where are you, Piggy?"
Something brush ed against the back of the shelter . Piggy kept still for a
moment, then he had his asthma . He arched his back and crashed among the
leaves with his legs. Ralph rolled away from him.
Then there was a vicious snarl ing in the mouth of the shelter and the
plunge and thump of living thing s. Someone tripped over Ralph and Piggy's
corner became a complication of snarls and crashes and flying limbs. Ralph
hit o ut; then he and what seemed like a dozen others were rolli ng over and
over , hit ting, bit ing, scratching. He was torn and jolted, found fingers in his
mouth and bit them. A fist withdrew and came back like a piston, so that the
whole shelter exploded into li ght. Ralph twisted sideways on top of a
writhing body and felt hot breath on his cheek. He began to pound the
mouth below him, using his clenched fist as a hammer; he hit with more
and mor e passio nate hysteria as the face became slippery . A knee jerked up
between his legs and he fell sid eways, busying himself with his pain, and
the fight rolled over him. Then the shelter collapsed with smothering
finality; and the anonymous sha pes fought their way out and through. Dark
figures drew themselves out of the wreckage and flitted away , till the
screams of the littluns and Piggy's gasps were once more audible.
Ralph called out in a quavering voice.
