a lar ger pebble c lung to its own  air and was covered with a coat of pearls.
The tide  swelled in over the rain-pitted sand and smoothed everything with
a lay er of silver . Now it touched the first of the stains that seep ed from the
broken body and the creatures  made a moving patch of light as they
gathered at the edge. The water rose farther and dressed Simon's coarse hair
with brightness. The line of his cheek silvered and the turn of h is shoulder
became sculptur ed marble. The strange attendant creatures, with their fiery
eyes and trailing vapors, busied themselves round his head. The  body lifted
a fraction of an  inch from the sand and a bubble of air escap ed from the
mouth with a wet plop. Then it turned gently in the water .
Somewhere ove r the darkened c urve of the world the sun and m oon were
pulling, and the film of water on  the earth planet was held, bulging slightly
on o ne side while the solid core turned. The great wave of the  tide moved
farther a long the  island and the water lifted. Softly , surrounded by a fringe
of in quisitive bright creatures, itself a silver shape beneath the steadfast
constellations, Simon's dead body moved out toward the open sea.
